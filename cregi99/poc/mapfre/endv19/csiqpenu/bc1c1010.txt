+
+This new Merge Output option is available in both foreground and batch.
+
+When used, it directs PDM to delete the Derivation 1 and Derivation 2
+elements from Endevor after a successful merge. After an element is
+merged at a new location, this option can be used for cleanup purposes.
+
+The delete will not occur if the merge completes with errors. Also, if
+the target location happens to be the same location as one of the
+derivations, that element will not be deleted.
