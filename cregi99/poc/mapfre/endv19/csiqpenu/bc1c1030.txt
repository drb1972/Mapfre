+
+This new Merge Output option allows you to assign or overrride a Processor
+Group name for an element after PDM finishes Endevor merge process.
+
+To override or assign a new processor group name:
+ - Use the PROCESSOR GROUP NAME merge option clause in batch mode.
+ - Update the PROCESSOR GROUP merge option field on the Merge Output
+   Specification panel in foreground mode.
+
+ If you do not provide a processor group name, one is selected for you.
+ - When the element is at the target location prior to the PDM merge,
+   the element will inherit the group name from that element.
+ - When the element is not at the target location but exists up the map,
+   the element will inherit that element's processor group name.
+ - The element type definition's default processor group name will be
+   used when the element cannot be found along its destination route.
