+The BUILD WIP Member Selection matrix provides new line commands:
+
%PRTMAT+- Allows the user to print a formatted version of the WIP
+   Selection Matrix to SYSOUT. The destination of the formatted matrix
+   controlled by parameters to the PRTMAT command and by defaults
+   specified on the PDM User Default panel.
+
%SORT+- Allows the user to SORT the Matrix table into ascending sequence
+   based on the contents of the WIP, Root, Derivation 1, Derivation 2
+   or WIP sequence number columns.
+
%LOCATE+- Allows the user to position the Matrix to a specified row.
+   The default column used by the LOCATE command is the WIP Member
+   name column, or the last column against which a SORT has been
+   performed. Optionally, the user can specify the column in which
+   LOCATE is to search for the value.
