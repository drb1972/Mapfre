+If the Build WIP process detects no conflicts between the Root and
+Derivation file(s), PDM can automatically create a Merge Output file
+from the WIP member.
+
+The auto-Merge function is enabled only if the user explicitly
+requests the function to be performed. The Merge Output member name
+is the same as the WIP member name specified for the Build WIP action.
