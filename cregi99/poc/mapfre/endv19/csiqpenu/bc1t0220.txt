+These fields allow you to set a default SYSOUT class and destination
+for the PDM Print Matrix (PRTMAT) command. The PRTMAT command allows
+you to print the WIP Member Selection Matrix.
+
+Modify these fields as necessary to conform to your site standards.
+
%SYSOUT Class+- Required Alpha-numeric character defining the SYSOUT
+    output class designation. This field is initialized to A.
+
%Destination+- Optional 1 to 17-character output destination identifier.
+    The format is NODE.USER. If only one parameter is used, PDM assumes
+    that it designates the USER. If blank, PDM defaults to LOCAL.
+    This field is equivalent to the DEST=  JCL statement.
+    For example, to set the default PRTMAT output destination to the
+    locally defined printer PRINTER1, specify PRINTER1 in this field.
+
%Writer Name+- Optional 1 to 8-character output writer name.  This field
+    is equivalent to the SYSOUT=(A,writer) JCL statement.
+
%NOTE+- The Destination and Writer Name fields are mutually exclusive.
