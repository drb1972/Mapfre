+The first step in using PDM is to build the Work-In-Process (WIP) file.
+PDM produces the WIP file by combining a Root file with one or two
+derivation files, noting all insertions and deletions from the derivation
+files, and flagging conflicting changes.
+
+The Build WIP process produces one or more of the following reports: The
+PDM Syntax Report, PDM Build WIP Detail Report, or the PDM Build WIP
+Summary Report. These reports are discussed in Chapter 6 of the User's Guide.
+
+There are up to five steps in the Build WIP process: Specifying a WIP
+library and build WIP options; Specifying a Root library; Specifying a
+Derivation 1 (Der1) library; Specifying a Derivation 2 (Der2) library
+(optional); Specifying a merge output data set (optional).
