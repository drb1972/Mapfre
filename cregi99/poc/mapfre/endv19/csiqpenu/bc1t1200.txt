+PDM builds the WIP file by adding, and annotating all the changes made
+to the Root file in the Derivation 1 and Derivation 2 files, then
+writing this new file in the WIP library.
+
+Once the WIP file has been built, you can edit it using the PDM Edit WIP
+function. PDM uses the edited WIP file as input to the Merge process.
