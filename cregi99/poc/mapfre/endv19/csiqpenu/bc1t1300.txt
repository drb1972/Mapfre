+PDM creates a merge output file or an Endevor merge output element from
+a WIP file. Before creating a merge output file or element, you must edit
+all conflicts out of the WIP file, or the merge output will fail. The WIP
+file can contain non-conflicting inserts and deletes.
+
+PDM creates a merge output file or element from a WIP file by removing the WIP
+header information, inserting and deleting lines as necessary, and removing
+the WIP annotations. PDM can create merge output files or elements in the
+following ways:
+  * Automatically, during the Build WIP process, when you specify
%    Automatically merge=Y+on the WIP Specification panel.
+
+  * Upon request, by invoking option%3+on the PDM Primary Options Pane l.
