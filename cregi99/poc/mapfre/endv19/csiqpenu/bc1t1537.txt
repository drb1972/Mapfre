+The WIPPARA command identifies each inserted or deleted paragraph in a
+WIP member. A paragraph is a block of lines that have the same operation
+(insert or delete) from the same Derivation file.
+
+The WIPPARA command adds a =NOTE= line immediately before the first line
+in the paragraph. The =NOTE= line identifies the type of paragraph. If the
+WIP file contains at least one paragraph, PDM positions the WIP member
+at the first paragraph found. To locate subsequent paragraphs you can use
+the ISPF/PDF LOCATE SPECIAL command. The ISPF/PDF RESET command will
+remove the =NOTE+ lines.
+
+To execute the WIPPARA command, type WIPPARA in the COMMAND field, then
+press ENTER.
+
+Use the WIPPARA command to assess the condition of the WIP file.
