+The WIPMERGE command allows you to test edits by creating a temporary
+merge file within an edit session.  If you do not like the results of
+one merge file, you can return to the WIP file and continue editing it.
+
+The WIPMERGE command executes pending edit commands,%saves+the current
+WIP member, and displays the merged file in browse mode. When you end
+the browse session, the WIP edit session resumes.
+
+To execute the WIPMERGE command, type WIPMERGE and, optionally, a single
+character change identifier in the command field, then press ENTER.
+
+PDM places the identifier in column 1 of the merge file when the line
+was inserted by either the Derivation 1 or Derivation 2 file. When you
+specify a change ID, the message 'Change ID Specified' appears in the
+upper right hand corner of the merge file. For example, the command
%WIPMERGE C+instructs PDM to put the letter C in the first column of
+any lines in the merge file inserted by the Derivation 1 or 2 files.
