+If you specify AUTOMATICALLY MERGE=Y on the WIP Specification panel,
+PDM will try to create a merge file or element from the WIP file
+automatically as the last step in the Build WIP process. PDM creates
+this merge only if it finds no conflicts in the WIP file.
+
%Note:+When PDM creates the merge output automatically during the Build
+      WIP process, the merge output file or element name is the same as
+      the WIP member name.
