+PDM creates a Merge Output file from a WIP file. Before invoking the
+Merge process, all conflicts must be edited out of the WIP file. The
+WIP file can contain non-conflicting inserts and deletes.
+
+When building a Merge Output file PDM:
+
+  * Removes the WIP header information.
+
+  * Inserts and deletes lines as necessary
+
+  * Removes the WIP annotations.
+
+  * Ignores comment lines.
