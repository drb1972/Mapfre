+PDM creates Endevor change levels from the WIP file. Each derivation
+is represented in a change level. The element is built at your specified
+Endevor location.
+
+Before invoking the Merge process you must edit all conflicts out of
+the WIP file or the merge process will fail. The WIP file can contain
+non-conflicting inserts and deletes.
+
+When building Merged Output PDM:
+
+  * Removes the WIP header information.
+
+  * Inserts and deletes lines as necessary
+
+  * Removes the WIP annotations.
+
+  * Ignores comment lines.
