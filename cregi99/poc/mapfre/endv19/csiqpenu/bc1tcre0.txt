+Once you have edited the matrix you can create WIP files or SCL for one
+or more rows by typing CREATE in the command field, then pressing ENTER.
+
%Note:+When you issue the CREATE command, PDM only processes included rows
+   that have at least a Root and Derivation 1 member.
+
+In foreground mode, PDM begins the Build WIP process for all included rows.
+In batch mode, PDM creates batch requests for all included rows, and
+writes the requests to the batch request data set. These batch files
+can be processed using the SUBMIT option on the Primary Option Panel.
+
+When the Build WIP process is complete, PDM returns the Parallel
+Development Manager - Primary Option Panel, with the message:
+
+   WIP Build Complete- If you are processing in foreground mode.
+
+   Requests Written- If you are processing in batch mode.
