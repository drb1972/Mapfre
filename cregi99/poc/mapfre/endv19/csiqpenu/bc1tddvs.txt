+Merging changes into Endevor can only occur when the Root, DV1
+and DV2 are all Endevor elements.
+
+This field indicates whether PDM is to delete the derivation 1 and 2
+elements after creating the merged Endevor changes.
+The default is%N+(do not delete DV1 and DV2 elements).
+
+PDM will only delete these elements if the merge ended with no errors.
+If the target location is the same location as one of the derivations,
+that element will not be deleted.
