+When using an inventory location as a Build WIP input location, you can
+tell PDM to use a level other than the current version/level during
+the Build WIP operation.
+
+If you know the version and level you want to use, you can enter them
+directly on the Root, Derivation 1 or Derivation 2 Specification Panel.
+Otherwise, you can review a Summary of Levels panel to find the
+version/level you want to use.
