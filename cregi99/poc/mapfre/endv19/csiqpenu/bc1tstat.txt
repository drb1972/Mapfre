+Use this field to name the data set to which you want PDM to write
+statistical information. The name must conform to ISPF naming
+conventions.

+PDM can optionally create data records containing detail and summary
+information about Build WIP or Merge actions. These statistical
+records can then be processed by a user program or passed as input
+to a SAS reporting system.
+
+See the appendix "Statistical Data Control Blocks" in the Parallel
+Development Option Guide for information about the formats of the
+statistical control blocks and about allocating the statistics
