+Integrating concurrently developed software requires varying levels
+of involvement by programmers and managers, depending on the
+complexity of the parallel development effort. There are three steps
+to the integration process:
+
+ *%Analysis.+To determine the scope of the integration project. This
+     can be handled by programmers in simple parallel development
+     situations. More managerial involvement is often required for
+     vendor updates or more complicated development projects.
+ *%Consolidation and conflict resolution.+Procedures need to be
+     established for gathering the proper programs and identifying
+     conflicts for resolution. Again, managerial involvement
+     increases as project complexity increases.
+ *%Integrating the changes.+This is often a manual process, one that
+     can be very time consuming and error prone in large or
+     complicated projects.
