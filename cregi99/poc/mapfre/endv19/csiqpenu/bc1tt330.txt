+The final step in the PDM process is to create a Merge Output File
+from a WIP File. A Merge Output File is a normal source file, and can
+be stored in the appropriate source repository, input to a compiler,
+or added into the Endevor inventory.
+
+Before creating a merge output file, all conflicts must be edited out
+of the WIP file. PDM creates the merge output file by performing the
+indicated insertions and deletions and removing WIP information.
