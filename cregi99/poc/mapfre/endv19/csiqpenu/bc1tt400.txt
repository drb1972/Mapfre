+To use PDM effectively, you should be familiar with the definitions
+of the following PDM files: the Root file; Derivation 1 and Derivation 2
+files; the Work-In-Process (WIP) file; the Merge Output file; the Merge
+Output Endevor element; and the Statistics file.
+
+A%Root+file refers to the base program with which programmers are
+working. Derivation 1 and Derivation 2 files are derived from this
+program. For example, the Root might be Release 1.0 of a vendor product;
+Derivation 1, your modifications to the product; and Derivation 2 the
+vendor's new release (1.1) of the product.
+
%Derivation 1+and%Derivation 2+files are user specified modifications
+of the Root file. PDM builds the Work-In-Process (WIP) file by
+comparing the Root, the Derivation 1 and, optionally, the Derivation 2
+files.
