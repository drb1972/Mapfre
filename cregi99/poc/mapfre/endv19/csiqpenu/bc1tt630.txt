+The PDM SAS reporting system provides two categories of reports,
+Build reports, and Merge reports.
+
+Build reports contain information about the Build WIP action:
+ * The%Build WIP Summary Report+(Report 01) identifies the Root, Derivation 1,
+     and Derivation 2 members for each WIP data set member, along with
+     complexity factor and comon insert/delete information.
+ * The%Build WIP Summary Report by Complexity Factor+(Report 02) sorts
+     the Summary report information by complexity factor.
+ * The%Build WIP Summary Report by WIP Member Name+(Report 03) sorts
+     the Summary report information by WIP data set member name.
+
+The%Merge Summary Report+(Report 04) provides summary information about
+the Merge action.
+
+All PDM SAS reports are generated from the statistics created when you
+code the WRITE STATISTIC TO clause in BUILD WIP or MERGE requests.
