+When specifying a WIP member, you can:
+
+ * Leave the field blank. PDM then builds a WIP library member list
+   that is identical to the Root library member list.
+
+ * Type an explicit member name. PDM then builds a WIP file for that
+   member only.
+
+ * Type an overlay mask.  An overlay mask differs from a standard name
+   mask in that the characters specified before the asterisk overlay
+   the corresponding characters in the Root member name. For example,
+   if you provide an overlay mask of W*, every WIP member name will begin
+   with the letter W. This means that Root member BC1PAL00 will appear
+   in the WIP library as member WC1PAL00.
