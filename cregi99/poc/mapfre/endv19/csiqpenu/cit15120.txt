%ELIB Support for z/OS VSAM Extended Addressability +

 The ELIB data set format supports z/OS VSAM extended addressability for
 VSAM data sets. The extended addressability feature allows you to allocate
 VSAM data sets that are larger than 4 gigabytes. If extended addressability
 is enabled in z/OS for any of your VSAM ELIB data sets, Endevor
 recognizes that this option is enabled and handles ELIB access appropriately.
 You do not need to make any changes in Endevor to enable support
 for extended addressability.

 Ask your Storage Administrator to determine whether z/OS VSAM extended
 addressability is available for your site and how you can implement it.
