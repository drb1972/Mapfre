%Autogen Action Option Enhancements +
+
 The%AUTOGEN+feature was enhanced to include the%AUTOGEN SPAN+
 parameter to enable cross-System and cross-Subsystem support.
 Previously, only "using" elements that were located in the same
 logical map as the component were generated. This enhancement
 allows "using" elements found in Systems and Subsystems not in
 the same map as the component being acted upon to be generated.

%Simulation mode+causes the actual execution of all actions in
 the batch job to be bypassed. No updates are performed. Use the
 C1MSGS1 and C1MSGS2 reports for impact analysis to see what the
 results would be if the actions are performed.

 The%&LIT          +option was added into the Optional Feature Table.
 When enabled and "using" elements are not found at the target
 location, the using elements are generated with%COPYBACK+instead
 of the%NOSOURCE+option.
