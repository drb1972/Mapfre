 The Global Type Sequencing feature is enhanced to provide a
 grouping capability that enables Concurrent Action Processing
 (CAP) to execute multiple types simultaneously.

 This enhancement is implemented using a new optional%Category+
 keyword in the SCL statements specified in the Global Type
 Sequencing member that defines the type processing order. This
 keyword groups types for simultaneous processing.
