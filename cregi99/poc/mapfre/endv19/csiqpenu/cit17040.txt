 The Endevor RESTful Web Services API (RESTful API) is an extension of
 the existing SOAP based web services feature. The RESTful API provides the
 Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style of web services,
 which uses HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). This architectural
 style provides a simpler, more lightweight API, scalability, improved
 performance and easier adoption due to a better known distributed/server-client
 application development model based on the HTTP protocol.

 In the RESTful architectural style, data and functionality are considered
 resources and are represented and accessed by URIs. These resources can be
 manipulated by a set of well-defined operations: Create, Read, Update and
 Delete. In the case of HTTP, these operations are the Request methods GET, PUT,
 POST, and DELETE.

 The current RESTful API functions focus on package processing actions
 and supporting actions for list operations.
