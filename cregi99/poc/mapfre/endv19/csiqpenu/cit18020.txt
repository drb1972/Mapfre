%Approver Disqualification
+
+The Approver Disqualification option enhances the audit integrity of
+Packages by preventing Package approvers from approving their own work.
+
+   Approvers cannot approve a Package that they Create, Update, or Cast.
+
+   Approvers cannot approve a Package that contains any Element they
+   changed, including changes to any level of the Element at the
+   specified source location. Disqualifying actions are:
+      Add, Alter, Update, Edit, Generate, Move, Restore, and Transfer.
+
+   Element actions that do not require Package Approval are not affected
+   by this option. These actions are Print, List and any actions that
+   are specified on the%&LIT1                +parameter in the Optional
+   Features table. The following actions can be specified:
+      Archive, Delete, Alter, Signin, and Transfer.
