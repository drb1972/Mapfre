%Approver Disqualification Option
+
+The%&LIT1                +parameter in the Optional Features table,
+ENCOPTBL,+activates the option. Three choices are supported: activate
+the option for both Standard and Emergency Package types; only
+activate the option for Standard Packages; or only activate the option
+for Emergency Packages.
+
+Approvers in internal approver groups can be disqualified during Cast
+processing. Dynamic approvers and approvers in external approver groups
+can be disqualified when they attempt to approve or deny a Package.
+
+   During Cast processing, each approver in the Package's internal
+   approver groups is validated.
+
+   For dynamic approver groups and external approver groups, the approver
+   IDs are not known at Cast time. Therefore, the approver is validated
+   when the user attempts to perform the Approve or Deny action.
