+
+   This new syntax method was created so that blanks can be inserted
+   at the end and/or beginning of a line and have them retained in the
+   name. When specifying the value for the name it must begin and end
+   with a quote. If the name will span multiple lines, there needs
+   to be a comma after the ending quote to indicate continuation of
+   the name value. The last line containing the name value without a
+   comma after the ending quote indicates the end of the name value.
+   This new syntax needs to be coded in columns 1-72. Any characters
+   in columns 73-80 are treated as a comment and ignored.
