%Alter Action Field Level Security Enhancement
+
+   This enhancement allows an administrator to limit who can perform
+   Alter action updates on Element record metadata depending on which
+   metadata field the user is attempting to update.
+
+   To take advantage of this feature, add the new keyword%ALTERFLD+
+   to a level of the%NAMEQU &LIT1            +entry on the External
+   Security Interface table, BC1TNEQU. When the security exit
+   encounters an Alter action and builds the pseudo data set name, a
+   value that corresponds to the metadata field specified on the Alter
+   action is substituted for the%ALTERFLD node+on the pseudo data set.
+
+   Your security administrator can configure your site's security
+   software to restrict users from this pseudo data set based on their
+   user profile. The External Security Interface and your security
+   software can then limit who can perform updates on specific fields.
