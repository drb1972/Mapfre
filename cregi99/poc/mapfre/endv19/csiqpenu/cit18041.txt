%Alter Action Field Level Security Enhancement
+
+   A separate call to the security exit is performed for each field
+   specified in an Alter action request. All fields in the Alter
+   request are verified, even if a previous field had failed the
+   security check. Fields%ECBALTRF+(Assembler) and%ECB-ALTER-FIELD+
+   (COBOL) were added to the exit control blocks to provide the
+   name of the field being altered during user exit 1 processing.
+
+   Values passed in%ALTERFLD+to the External Security Interface:
