%Web Services Configuration Enhancements
+
+The Web Services installation and configuration process has been
+modified to minimize the exposure to configuration-related errors
+and to provide a process to validate the installation and configuration
+parameters. The installation process has been changed as follows:
+
+   - A new central properties file%(ENWSInstallOptions.properties)
+     contains parameters that allow you to tailor the installation
+     according to your environment.
+   - Endevor provides scripts for the configuration of the
+     security access to Web Services.
+   - Endevor provides scripts for the installation, update and
+     validation of Web Services.
+   - Endevor provides a "round trip" validation utility that
+     validates the setup and configuration of all parts of Web Services.
+     The utility is a Java command-line application that can be used
+     under various OS environments.
