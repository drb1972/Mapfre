%Disqualification for Approver Groups
+
+ With this enhancement the Endevor Administrator can turn the Approver
+ Group Disqualification option on or off by approver group.
+ Turning this option on in an approver group means that an approver
+ who has updated an element in the package or who has updated the
+ package itself will be disqualified as an approver for this
+ approver group.
+
+%Note:+If the site-wide ENCOPTBL option%&LIT1                +
+       is on it overrides the approver group setting.
