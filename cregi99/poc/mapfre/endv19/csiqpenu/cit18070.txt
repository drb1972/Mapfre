%SMF Recording/Monitoring for Admin Action Activity
+
+ With this enhancement, the Endevor administrator can record
+ administrative action activity to SMF. Admin actions are actions that
+ create, modify, or delete:  Endevor inventory definitions, such
+ as System, Subsystem, Type, Processor Group, Approver Group, and
+ Approver Group Relations; and  Package definitions, such as destination,
+ DSN mapping rules, and USS mapping rules.
+
+ You can also have a copy of these admin action SMF records written to a
+ log file. SMF recording must be active to use the log file.
