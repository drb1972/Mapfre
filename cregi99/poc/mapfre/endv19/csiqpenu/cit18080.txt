%Allow Processor to Continue when a Data Set is Not Found
+
+ Specifying the parameter%ALLOC=COND+on a processor DD statement enables
+ the processor to continue executing if any data sets cannot be allocated
+ due to a%"Not Found"+condition. When this happens, an informational message
+ is issued providing the DDNAME and DSNAME of the skipped data set.
+
+ If the%ALLOC+keyword specifies either%LMAP+or%PMAP+along with the%COND+
+ parameter, the%COND+value is propagated to each data set in the map
+ allocation. Multiple parameters for the ALLOC keyword must be enclosed
+ within parentheses, for example:%ALLOC=(LMAP,COND).
+
+ The%ALLOC=COND+parameter requires that%DISP=SHR+or%DISP=OLD+be
+ specified on the DD statement.
+
+ A specification of%ALLOC=COND+for concatenated data sets may result
+ in some data sets being skipped, all data sets that can be allocated
+ are allocated and are concatenated to the associated DDNAME.
