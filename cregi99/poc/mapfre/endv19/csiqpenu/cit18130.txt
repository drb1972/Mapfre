%Quick Edit Support for Mixed-Case Long-Named Elements
+
+ With this enhancement, Quick Edit now fully supports Mixed-Case and
+ Long-Named Elements, meaning that you can perform all of the available
+ Quick Edit actions against these Elements.  In addition, you can set the
+ Element Column Width for selection lists via the Dialog Defaults option
+ in Quick Edit to specify a width of from 8 to 30 characters. Support for
+ a 132 character wide screen on the Element selection list is also provided,
+ allowing more columns of data to be displayed.
