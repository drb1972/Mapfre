%ISPF Add, Update, Retrieve & Transfer Panels Made Scrollable
+
+ In the ISPF Classic interface, the Add, Update, Retrieve & Transfer
+ panels are now vertically scrollable.  This change allows all of the
+ Action Options to be specified on each of the action panels, so that
+ you no longer have to go to a separate panel to change these options.
