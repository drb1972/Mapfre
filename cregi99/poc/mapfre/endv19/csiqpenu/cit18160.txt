%End-to-End Package Action Logging for ALC
+
+ This enhancement allows customers to turn on logging of Endevor Package
+ actions to a USS directory for integration with the Application Lifecycle
+ Conductor product.  A new C1DEFLTS table parameter, E2ELOGMBR, is
+ available to specify the PARMLIB member that contains the USS directory
+ name to be used for logging of these actions.
