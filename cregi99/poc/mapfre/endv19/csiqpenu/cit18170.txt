%Footprint Source Output Member With Generate Timestamp
+
+ When an Element is moved, the current level of the Element is written to
+ the source output library (if defined for the type) in the target location.
+ The footprint in the source output library member reflects the date and
+ time of the move action.
+
+ This enhancement introduces a new optional feature in the ENCOPTBL table,
+%&LIT1                              +which can be turned on in order to
+ override the default behavior so that the date and time in the footprint
+ reflects the date and time of the last generate action when EXPAND INCLUDES
+ is "N" in the Type Definition.
+ The date and time stamp in the source output library member footprint will
+ not change when moving an Element up the map.
