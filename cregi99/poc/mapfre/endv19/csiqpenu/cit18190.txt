%Deploy for Test Using the Quick Edit UI
+
+ The Quick Edit Deploy for Test feature copies Elements and their executables
+ from a development sandbox to a test sandbox. You can use the Deploy action
+ repeatedly to deploy from the same development sandbox to multiple test
+ sandboxes. Deploying to multiple test sandboxes lets you test the Elements in
+ different test environments.
+
+ For more information regarding implementing and using the Deploy for Test
+ feature, please see%Administrating+in the Endevor documentation.
