+ On any action panel, the UPPERCASE option lets you specify whether the Element
+ name that you enter will be accepted as a mixed case value or be converted to
+ an uppercase value. This option is now available on all action panels.
+ In addtion, the CASE-SENSITIVE option, which determines whether the match
+ function is case-sensitive, has been renamed to CASE-SENSITIVE ELM NM.
+%Report Requests
+ You can now code a mixed-case 1- to 255-character Element name when requesting
+ certain reports in foreground. The setting of the UPPERCASE field determines
+ whether the Element name entered will be uppercased or not in the SCL.
+ These enhancements are available on the following request panels: Master
+ Control File Report, Historical (SMF) Reports and Unload/Reload Reports.
+%Element Summary Panels
+ Standardize the format of the two location lines on all of the element
+ summary panels. The element name has been expanded to 60 characters and
+ the location information will appear on the line below the element name.
