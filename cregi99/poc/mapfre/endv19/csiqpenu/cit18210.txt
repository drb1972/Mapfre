%Web Services RESTful API client & Eclipse-Based UI
+
% Web Services RESTful API client
+ The Create and Update Package actions are separated into two different REST
+ methods in the RESTful API. The Create Package action uses the POST method
+ and the Update Package action uses the PUT method. The mixed parameters of
+ Multipart/form-data and query are replaced solely by Multipart/form-data
+ parameters for Create and Update Package actions.
+
% Eclipse-Based UI Package Create option renamed
+ When you want to create a Package, but plan to add the SCL to the Package
+ later, you can select the option Define Package without SCL from the
+ Create Package dialog. Previously, this option was labeled Define Empty
+ Package. The functionality has not changed; only the name of the option has
+ changed.
