%Redesign of Eclipse Plug-In Local File Management
+
+ This enhancement changes the way that Elements are handled locally
+ in the Eclipse plugin.
+
+ When you add an Element to a Project, it is retrieved from the Endevor
+ repository to your computer where you are using the plugin. The Element file
+ on your computer is the local Element. An Element will have a local Element
+ when it is opened (Endevor Retrieve action) and downloaded to an
+ Eclipse plug-in project.
+
+ You can edit a local Element and save the changes to the local Element.
+ Optionally, you can also save the changed Element back to the Endevor
+ repository. There are various states describing the relationship between a
+ local Element and its corresponding Element in the Endevor repository.
+ Icons and tooltips for the local Elements in the project help you to
+ identify the relationships.
