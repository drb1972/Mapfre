%Element Delta Levels Moved With History Indicator
+
+ With this enhancement a new history Indicator%"H"+has been added to the%SYNC+
+%column+to help identify Element delta levels that were moved or transferred
+ as part of a group, signifying that these delta levels were never the last
+ (current) level at the Element's current location.  These History delta levels
+ are present due to a Move or Transfer action, with the With History action
+ option, from some other location. Note that the H indicator can appear in the
+ SYNC column along with the S (sync) or C (consolidation) indicators.
+
+%For example:+Assume that Element level 0104 exists at Stage 1 and level 0101
+ exists at Stage 2. If a Move with History is performed, the following results:
+  - Element delta levels 0102 and 0103%will have+the%H+indicator added because
+    they were copied as part of the with history option and were never the
+    last levels at Stage 2
+  - Element delta level 0104%will not have+the%H+indicator as it is the last
+    level at the target location.
