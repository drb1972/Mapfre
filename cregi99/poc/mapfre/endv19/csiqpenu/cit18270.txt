%Element Activity Logging for Webhook Support
+
+ Certain Element actions can be logged to USS files, which can be used to
+ support Webhooks. These actions are: Retrieve, Add, Update, Generate,
+ Move, Delete and Transfer (From Endevor to Endevor).
+ The administrator can specify which Element actions get logged depending
+ on their inventory location (Environment and Stage) and application
+ classification (System and Subsystem).
+
+ To enable Package action logging or Element action logging, the administrator
+ codes SCL statements in the PARMLIB member that is pointed to by the
+ E2ELOGMBR setting in the C1DEFLTS table. Previously, to enable Package action
+ logging, the PARMLIB member only had to contain the USS directory name that
+ was used for logging.
+
+ Note: Package action logging was introduced in increment 18.0.08.
