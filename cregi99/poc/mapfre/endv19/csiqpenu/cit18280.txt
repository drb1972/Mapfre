%Intelligent Package Shipment Destination Selection Lists
+
+ With this enhancement, when a Destination Selection List is displayed from the
+ Package Shipment panel, only relevant destinations are listed.  Relevant
+ destinations are those where at least one Package output can be shipped,
+ either by an explicit "maps to" mapping rule or by default (the output is
+ not "EXCLUDED"). This change will prevent selecting a shipment destination
+ from the list for a package where no outputs can be shipped.
+
+ This enhancement also introduces a new optional feature table (ENCOPTBL) entry
+%&LIT1                       +that causes only destinations that contain
+ an explicit "maps to" mapping rule for at least one of the package outputs
+ to be listed in the Package Shipment Destination Selection List panel.
+
+ Note that any defined destination can still be coded directly on the Package
+ Shipment panel, even if it would be excluded from the Package Shipment
+ Destination Selection List.
