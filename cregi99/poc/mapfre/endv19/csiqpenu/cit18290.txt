%User option for ISPF panel layout (Dynamic Panel support)
+
+  The ISPF interfaces are enhanced to allow user selectable layout options:
%  S-Short+- For users who do NOT make use of long Element names, or need USS
+            file support.  This option formats the panel in the earlier panel
+            style and hides options these users do not need.
%  L-Long+-  For users who want a panel layout that can display a long Element
+            name at the top (followed by type, CCID and COMMENT where
+            appropriate). The related options Uppercase, Case-Sensitive, and
+            USS path and file names are visible and active.
+
+  Each user can choose their preferred value from the User Defaults dialog,
+  but the system administrator sets the site default via the%&lit1
+  ENDICNFG Configuration Table parameter.
+
%Hide Dialog Prompt Text+- In the Quick Edit dialog, there is a further option
+  to tailor how the dialog prompt help text is displayed.  When set to 'Y' an
+  abreviated version of the help text is shown.  This is suitable for
+  experienced users who do not need to be reminded of all the options and
+  prefer the extra screen space.  In the default setting, 'Y' the full prompt
+  text is shown.  In either case point-n-shoot can be used to perform the
+  action.  Use%&lit2             +in the configuration table to override the
+  default.
