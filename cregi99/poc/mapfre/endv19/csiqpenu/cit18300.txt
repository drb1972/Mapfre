%Eclipse Based UI Enhancements
+
%  Add or Retrieve from or to local file system
+  You can add or update Elements from your local file system to Endevor.
+  You can also retrieve Elements to your local file system from Endevor.
+  There is no longer a need to upload (or download) local files outside of
+  Endevor.
+
%  Add or Retrieve from or to PDS and USS
+  You can add or retrieve an Element from or to a PDS or USS file. This enables
+  management of Endevor elements as part of a z/OS Project in IBM Developer for
+  z Systems, and Broadcom Development for z Systems.
+
%  Merge changes to an Element in an entry stage
+  If a local Element is edited or a synchronization conflict occurs between the
+  local and the corresponding Endevor Element, you can compare the
+  differences between the local and Endevor Element. The Eclipse Compare
+  and Merge action lets you compare the files and then edit and save the local
+  Element to resolve the conflict.
+
%  Inclusion of non-project Elements into Endevor package
+  An Endevor package that contains Elements from outside a corresponding
+  project location can now be used at any stage of the lifecycle.
+
%  Dynamic resolution of COBOL copybooks managed by Endevor in Broadcom
%  Development Environment for z Systems editor
+  Where copybooks are managed as an Endevor element, you can utilize Broadcom
+  Development Environment for z Systems functionality for displaying a copybook
+  when editing a COBOL member.
+
%  Prompt user to override signout of an Element during Add-to-project and
%  Add-to-Endevor workflows
+  To avoid the failure of an add-to-project or an add-to-Endevor request caused
+  by a signout state, you are prompted to override the signout of an Element
+  when the current signout status would prevent it from being added.
+
%  Visual improvements to the Eclipse based UI
+  Enhanced status indicator icons and a revised local and remote project
+  subtree structure make it easier to understand the status and location of
+  Elements. For more information, see Project View and Element Status.
