%Quick Edit Additional Columns in Element Selection List
+
%  Quick Edit now shows more detail.
+  With this change Quick Edit now has additional columns in the Element
+  selection list views. In addition to%Last Action date,+Quick Edit now
+  shows;%Current Date+(Source change),%Generate Date, Move Date,+and%Locked
+ %Package+name.
+
+  These fields are also fully supported for sorting, so for example the
+  command%"ESORT -CUR"+will put the most recently modified elements at the top
+  of the list.  You can also use the EONLY command to filter the list for
+  elements that are locked to package, for example%"EONLY LOCK ESCM"+will show
+  only elements locked to a package names that starts with ESCM.
+
+  Additionally support is extended to use other screen widths enabled by
+  dynamic%LOGMODE=D4C32XX3+(e.g. 122x44 or 160x60).  Quick Edit will now try
+  to fit as many columns as possible in the available screen width.  If a
+  column does not entirely fit you can still use column scrolling%(LEFT/RIGHT)
+  or the%EXPAND+command to see the whole contents.
