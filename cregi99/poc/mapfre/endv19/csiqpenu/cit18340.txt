%Quick Edit Add compare support for COMPELM
+
%  Endevor Quick Edit+now supports a new primary command,%COMPELM,+which can
+  be used to compare the current Element to any other Element in Endevor
+  in a similar manner to the%ISPF COMPARE+command. On invocation the
+  user may optionally specify an Element name or filter the Element
+  selection list, or use the NEXT keyword to default to looking up the
+  map using the current Element name and type. The COMPARE keywords EXCLUDE/X,
+  SAVE and SYSIN are also supported.
+
%  Compare Elements (COMPELM)
+  The%COMPELM+command enables you to compare the current Element with another
+  Element in Endevor and, if required, merge changes into the current Element
+  using the%MD+(MakeData) line command.  The compared Element that you select
+  can either be another Element or a different version of the same Element,
+  taken from a different location on the map.
+
%  Follow these steps:
+  - Type the COMPELM command on the command line of the ISPF Edit panel of the
+    Element that you want to use as a basis for your comparison.
+  - The Element COPY/COMPARE filter panel opens.
+  - Complete any filter specifications that you require:  Environment, Type,
+    Subsystem, and so on.
+  - The Element Selection List panel opens.
+  - Type%S+(for Summary) next to the Element that you want to select a specific
+    version of.
+  - The Summary of Element Levels panel opens.
+  - Type%CO+(for Compare) next to the version and level (VVLL) that you want to
+    compare your current Element with.
+  - A merge of the two Elements displays.
+
+  You can also issue%B+(Browse),%C+(Changes),%H+(History) and%M+(Master) line
+  commands to view information about the element before selecting%CO.+
+
%  Reading the COMPELM Merge Panel
+  The following illustration shows an example of a merge of two
+  Elements created using the COMPELM command:
+
%  ELE03        +%TO: ENV1/1/EZSYS/EZSUB/COPYBOOK             Changes are shown
+  Command ===>                                                 Scroll ===> CSR
+  ****** *************************** Top of Data *****************************
+ %======+ELEO3 This is a changed element with a few obvious (EXTRA)
+ %.OAAAA+ELEO3 This is a changed element with a few obvious
+  000002 ELE03 lines that can be inserted and changed.
+  000003 ELE03 Please try the COPYELM command to add another element
+  000004 ELE03 somewhere in the middle, top or bottom of this element
+  000005 ELE03 For example you might pick ELE01 or ELE02
+  000006 ELE03 It has some extra history
+ %======+ELE03 lines that are added to
+ %======+ELE03 at the bottom
+  ****** ************************** Bottom of Data ***************************
+
+  Lines that exist only in the Element that you are editing are marked with
+ %.OAAAA+(where the suffix is incremented alphabetically). If Edit highlighting
+  is enabled, these lines display in a different color.  Lines that exist only
+  in the Element that is being compared are inserted as information lines
+  (marked by equals signs) in the Element that is being edited.
+  You can jump to the next unique or missing line using the%L LABEL+or
+ %L SPECIAL+primary commands.
+
+  COMPELM supports the following parameters of the ISPF COMPARE command:
+    NEXT EXCLUDE SYSIN SAVE
+  COMPELM does not support the following parameters of the COMPARE command:
