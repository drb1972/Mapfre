+
%  New Landing Page for Endevor related content
+  A new text line with the prompt "Learn more" and a URL is optionally added
+  to the Endevor primary screens just above the copyright line.
+
+  The linked page brings together links to a range of resources designed to
+  make your use of Endevor easier and more effective.  For example;
+  - Access product training
+  - Watch how-to videos
+  - Get involved - Help improve our products through hands-on validation
+  - Take part in live demos, webinars and surveys
+  - Access the Customer Validation Community
+
%  Enabling the Learn-More link:
+  The Learn-More links are enabled by the Endevor administrator through a new
+  setting in the configuration table: 'UI_OPT_DSPL_LEARN_MORE'.
+
%  Is the link "Clickable"?
+  The Learn-More links displays the full URL to jump to the Endevor-Learn-More
+  page, however it will depend on your emulator as to whether it supports this
+  field as a hot-link, if it does not work as expected check your emulator's
+  settings.  If that doesn't work you can still copy and paste the link.
+
%  Try it and see...
+  You can change the current setting of this flag (for this session only) by
