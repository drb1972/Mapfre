% Automatic Element Version Rolling +

+ With this feature, the first step towards the removal of the concept of
  element versions has taken place.  Element versions have been incorporated
  into the level of an element, allowing an element to add levels up to
 %9996,+starting at level%0100.+ The transition from level%0199+to%0200+(and
  then 0299 to 0300, etc.) happens automatically.  No user intervention is
  required.  This feature is automatically enabled with the installation of this
  release.  Elements containing more than%100+levels (the element level is
  greater than 0199) are not backward compatible with prior Endevor
  releases.
