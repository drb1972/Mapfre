 %number of months,+automatically compressing change levels older than the
  number of months specified in the%system definition+when an element is
  moved to the%last stage+in the Endevor map. There is also a utility
  that can be scheduled periodically to compress those change levels for
  elements that are rarely changed.  The maximum number of months that can be
  specified is%999.+ This feature is optional and is selected when a system is
  defined.  It can be added to an existing system at any time.
