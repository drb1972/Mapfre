+ Promotion packages is a new feature that allows you to use a single package
  for moving inventory up through the Endevor map, without having to
  edit the package SCL.  A package specified as a promotion package can only
  contain%MOVE+actions.  Once the package has been executed successfully, the
 %MOVE FROM+location specified in the SCL is automatically updated to the next
  location in the map and the package is%CAST+automatically and becomes ready to
  be approved or executed for the move to the next location in the map.
