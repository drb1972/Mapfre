% Environment Name Masking +

+ Environment name masking (wildcarding) is now available on most Endevor
  and Quick Edit panels.  Masking can be used on the environment name just as
  it can be used for the other inventory location fields.  On the Quick Edit
  primary option panel, you still have the option of generating a list of
  environments to choose from by setting the panel option
 %DISPLAY ENV/SYS/SUBSYS LIST+to%Y,+which was updated to include environment.
