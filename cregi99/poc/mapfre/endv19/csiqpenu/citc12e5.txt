% API-CSV Promotion Package Filtering Enhancement +

+ The following enhancements are made to the promotion
  package feature:

  The Package Foreground Options menu panel includes
  changes to the promotion package target environment and
  target stage ID filters. The Tgt Environment and the Tgt
  Stage ID fields are independent. If the Promotion Pkg field
  is set to A or P, you can specify both fields, or leave one
  blank. Previously, you could specify the target
  environment alone, but if you specified the target stage
  ID, the target environment was required. Name masking is
  supported for both fields. Previously, name masking was
  not allowed.
