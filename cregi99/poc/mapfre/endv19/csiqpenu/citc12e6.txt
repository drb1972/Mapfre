% API-CSV Promotion Package Filtering Enhancement (Continued)+

  The CSV Utility's List Package ID function now includes the
  promotion package filters, which filter by promotion
  package type, promotion package target environment, and
  promotion package stage ID. Previously, the promotion
  package filter only filtered by promotion package type.

  The API List Package Header function now includes fields in
  the request structure for the promotion package target
  environment and promotion package stage ID, in addition
  to the promotion package flag. The promotion package flag
  was also renamed to promotion package filter type and
  supports values of A, P, or X. The promotion package fields
  are now returned in the response structure when the basic
  data option is specified. Previously promotion package data
  was returned only when the full data flag was specified.
