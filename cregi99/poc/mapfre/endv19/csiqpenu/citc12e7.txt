  The Package Display panel now displays the promotion
  package target environment and stage ID fields, provided
  that data exists for these fields. This information was
  already displayed on the Package Selection List and the
  Package History Selection List.

  The default STOPRC value for CSV actions was increased
  from 12 to 16, to be consistent with batch element and
  package action processing.
