% Integrated PDM Enhancement +

+ The Integrated PDM Enhancement allows for the result of a Parallel
  Development Manager (PDM) merge to be placed directly into an Endevor
  inventory location, retaining the original derivation's CCID, Comment,
  timestamp and User ID in the resulting, merged element.

  An additional feature of this enhancement is to be able to initiate
  PDM from within the Quick-Edit environment, without exiting
  Quick-Edit, and to then return to the Quick-Edit session after the PDM
  session is complete.
