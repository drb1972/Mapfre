 The Promotion Package Stop-at-Stage feature lets administrators define
 inventory lifecycle stages at which the automatic processing of promotion
 packages is suspended. This allows promotion packages to be shipped from a
 location other than the final location defined in the map. To enable this
 feature, the administrator sets the stop-at-stage parameters in the
 environment section of the C1DEFLTS table.
