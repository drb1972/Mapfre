 This feature, when specified for an element, will automatically generate the
 elements that use this component element.  For example, specifying AUTOGEN for
 an element of type MACRO would automatically generate the SOURCE elements that
 use the macro, which would in turn generate the appropriate LNK elements.
 NoSource option is enabled for all the Generate actions built by Autogen.
 Autogen is available only if the option Endevor Automated
 Configuration Manager is enabled at your site.

 This feature is a "batch only" option. It cannot be specified on actions
 that are defined in a package. This feature is supported on the ADD, UPDATE
 and GENERATE actions and can be enabled by specifying a new action option
 named AUTOGEN.
