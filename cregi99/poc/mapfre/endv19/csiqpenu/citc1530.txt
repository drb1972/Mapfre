 This feature is a middleware layer that runs in a z/OS USS environment and
 connects internet client applications to a Endevor repository through
 the Endevor API. The Eclipse Plug-in uses Endevor Web Services to
 connect to Endevor. In addition, you can use Endevor Web Services to
 enable your user-written client applications to access Endevor.
 Possible client applications include browser, mobile, anonymous, or
 Rich Client Platform (RCP) programs.
