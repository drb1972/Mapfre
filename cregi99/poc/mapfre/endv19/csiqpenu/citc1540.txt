%Log Delta Format for Element Types
+
 This enhancement introduces a new source management element delta format to
 Endevor. This delta format will keep activity information by version/level,
 but will NOT keep source code changes between the levels in its delta member.
 This feature addresses extremely large data files where source code management
 is not needed, but an activity log is still required. The element's last level
 source code will be kept in the element's base library.
