%Package Shipment Destinations for XCOM Transmission
+
 This enhancement supports the IPNAME parameter. This change is limited to
 the XCOM transmission method. XCOM clients can specify either the 1-8
 character NODENAME or the 1-63 character IPNAME. If an attempt to specify both
 is made or an IPNAME value is specified for a non-XCOM Destination definition,
 an error message is issued.

 This enhancement also provides the ability to specify an IPPORT number along
 with the IPNAME. If the IPNAME is specified, an IPPORT value must be provided.
