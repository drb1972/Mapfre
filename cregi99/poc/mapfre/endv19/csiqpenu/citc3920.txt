%ESORT command for sorting Endevor ISPF selection lists +

+ The ESORT (abbreviated ES) command can be used to sort any Endevor
  selection list by column.  To sort a list, type "ES column heading"
  on the ISPF command line.  Column heading is the name appearing at the
  top of the column.  If you would like to sort the list in descending
  sequence, prepend the column heading name with a "-".

  Example:   ES GENERATE  sorts the Display Element selection list by
                          generate date.

             ES -VVLL     sorts the selection list by verson and level
                          in descending sequence

             ES           sorts the selection list in the default sequence
