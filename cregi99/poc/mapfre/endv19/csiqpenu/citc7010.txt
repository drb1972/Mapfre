+ Global Type Sequencing-When this optional feature is enabled, SCL and API
  element actions are executed in type sequence order at the site level in a
  sequence defined by the AllFusion Endevor Administrator, regardless of the
  inventory location of each action.  This order is defined at the site level
  in the Type Sequence member created by the Endevor Administrator.

+ A type processing sequence is used when multiple element types are processed
  within a single batch request.
