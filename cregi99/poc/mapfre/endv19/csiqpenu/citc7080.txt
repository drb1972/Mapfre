+ The Package Display panel now displays the date and destination ID of the
  most recent shipment record and allows direct access to the Package Shipment
  Status panel for the displayed package.

  panel, LAST SHIPPED and DEST-ID. If applicable, these fields will contain
  the date, time and destination ID of the most current shipment record for
  the displayed package. This enhancement also adds a new option to the
  Package Display panel, SH - Display Ship Status Information. This option
  will only be available if ship records exist for the displayed package
  selecting this option will bring the user to the Package Shipment Status
  panel for the selected package.
