%Email Notification Administration Usabililty Improvements+

+ An optional parameter in the ESMTPTBL table (which defines email addresses
  for mainframe userids) constructs default email addresses for user ids that
  are not explicitly listed in the ESMTPTBL.

+ Additional enhancements include the ability to query the ESMTPTBL, an easy-
  to-use interface utility program that allows you to write simple email
  programs, improved readability of override signout message text, the ability
  to suppress override signout email and the ability to modify the "FROM"
  data in the email message.
