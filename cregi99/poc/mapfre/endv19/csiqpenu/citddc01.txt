+Use this panel to review the contents of the destination configuration member
+of the Endevor PARMLIB data set. This member is parsed for display on this
+panel so it is a good idea to use this display option to check the validity of
+the destination configuration member after making a change.
+
+The member must be edited to make changes. You cannot make changes to the
+member through this display only option.
+
+The LEFT and RIGHT commands (usually PF10 and PF11) are available on this
+panel to display the full 72 character Symbol Value field in the list and to
+fill in the destination ID on every line, useful when sorting via ESORT on the
%Value+field.
