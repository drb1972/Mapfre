+Define subsystems for specific applications within systems. For example
+you might define subsystems PO (purchase order) and AP (accounts payable)
+within system FINANCE. Keep in mind that:
+
+  * There must be at least one subsystem per system
+  * A subsystem must be defined to each system where it will be used. For
+    example, if system FINANCE is defined to environments TEST, QA, and PROD,
+    then subsystem PO will have to be defined to system FINANCE in each
+    environment.
+  * A subsystem can have the same name as the system to which it is defined.
