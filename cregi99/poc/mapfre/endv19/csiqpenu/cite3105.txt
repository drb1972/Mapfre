+Exclude the subsystem from the Duplicate Element Processor Output check.
+
+When the System definition has this option active across subsystems, this
+option can be used to exclude a subsystem from the check.
+
+The "Duplicate Element Processor Output check, Across Subsystem", compares
+the current action's processor output type value against all processor
+output types of all same named elements in the same system, different
+subsystems. If any are equal, the current action will fail with a
+registration error.
