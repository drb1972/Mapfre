%USS RECFMs+- USS files and files local to the Enterprise
+             Workbench are streams. To emulate records, there
+             has to be a record delimiter. This is the purpose of the
+             USS RECFM field.  If not specified for an HFS file, a
+             default value of NL is used.  Record delimiters and
+             their USS delimiter type are as follows;
+
+            %COMP+- Endevor compressed variable length records.
+            %CR  +- Carriage Return (ASCII & EBCDIC "CR" is hex '0D').
+            %CRLF+- EBCDIC Carriage Return/Line Feed (hex '0D25').
+            %CRNL+- EBCDIC Carriage Return/New Line  (hex '0D15').
+            %F   +- Fixed length.
+            %LF  +- EBCDIC Line Feed (hex '25').
+            %NL  +- EBCDIC New Line character.  This is the delimiter
+                    used by the editor, OEDIT and the browser, OBROWSE.
+                    If not specified, NL is the default.
