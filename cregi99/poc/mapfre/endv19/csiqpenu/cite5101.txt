+Use this panel to review the processing sequence for types defined
+to your site.
+
+The Parmlib and Typeseqmbr values in the C1DEFLTS Table define the
+dataset name and member for the Type Sequence Table defined at your
+site.
+
+The Category value does not affect the type sequencing order and is only used
+when Concurrent Action processing is activated. When multiple types are defined
+with the same category value, those actions will execute simultaneously.
