+Packages can be approved or denied for execution by people identified
+as approvers. An approver group is a set of approvers.

+You can specify the following for approver groups:

+ %Disqualification+- This setting has no effect if ENCOPTBL option
+ %&LIT1                +is ON:
+    Y - Disqualification processing for approvers will take place.
+    N - Disqualification processing for approvers will not take place.
+    Approvers can be disqualified (prevented from approving a package)
+    if they have updated the package or an element within the package.
+ %Quorum size+- The number of approvers in a group that must approve a
+    package before it can be executed.
+ %Required approvers+- Required approvers must approve a package before
+    it can be executed.

+Even if quorum requirements are met, a package cannot be executed until
+all required approvers have approved it.
