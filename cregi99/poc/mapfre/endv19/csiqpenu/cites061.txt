%End to End Log Mbr+- This is the name of the End-to-End action activity log
      member within the PARMLIB data set. This member is used to specify the
      name of the USS directories for logging Package and/or Element action
      activity for use by the Application Lifecycle Conductor product. For
      Element action activity logging, the actions and the inventory locations
      can be specified for which logging will occur.
%
%Deferred File Creation Mbr+- This is the name of the Deferred File Creation
      member within the PARMLIB data set. This member is used to specify data
      set names and allocation parameters for files that do not exist when
      Endevor attempts to allocate them. Files that fail allocation because they
      do not exist and have a match within this member are allocated as new
      files using the parameters specified in the matching entry and processing
      continues. Endevor symbols can be used to specify the data set names,
      including the LIKE data set name. Symbol substitution for the data set
      names will take place at the time the new allocation is done and before
      matching of the data set names takes place.
