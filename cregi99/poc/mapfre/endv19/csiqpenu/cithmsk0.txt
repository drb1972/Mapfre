%
+A 1- to 44-character name or mask for a data set at a host site.
+
+The name or mask is made up of qualifiers separated by periods. A
+qualifier contains 1 to 8 characters. It can be explicit, fully wild,
+or partially wild.
+
+Explicit  - The first character is alphabetic and the remaining
+            characters are alphanumeric or national (@, #, $).
+Full Wild - The qualifier consists of a single asterisk.
+Part Wild - Same as explicit, except that the final character is an *.
+
+A Host Dataset Name Mask must have the same number of qualifiers as the
+input production data set(s) it will match. The mask PROD.*.* will
+match PROD.FINANCE.LOADLIB but not PROD.LOADLIB.  Partially wild
+example: PROD.LOAD* matches PROD.LOAD and PROD.LOADLIB.
