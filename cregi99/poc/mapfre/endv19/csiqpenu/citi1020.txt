+  CD18102   QUICK EDIT USER ROUTINES FEATURE
+
+  This feature enables sites to add their own custom user extension points
+  to Quick Edit.  Once enabled, if the user enters a un-recognized line
+  command in Quick Edit, Endevor will search for a REXX or CLIST with the
+  name NDUSRXxx (where xx is that command).  If found that routine is called
+  using ISPF SELECT CMD service passing the details of the current row as
+  shared pool variables.  The routine then performs that custom action and
+  may update the default "status" message to indicate what it did.
+
+  User Extension point routines are treated like Exits in that they are not
+  directly supported by Broadcom, however, several sample routines are
+  provided that you could enable and use as a basis for building your
+  own routines.  We encourage you to share your requirements on the
+  community forums and potentially any code you build could be contributed.
+
+  Currently the available User Routine commands available are;
+  &C1QEUSRM
