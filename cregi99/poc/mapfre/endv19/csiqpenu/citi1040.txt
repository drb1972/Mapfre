+  CD18104   SYNC IN PLACE ACTION FEATURE
+
+  This feature enables the user to perform a "sync in place" on an element
+  that is out of sync with it's next version up the map without having to
+  use a MOVE action with SYNC or having to delete and re-add the element.
+
+  To use the feature from Quick Edit, enable it in the optional feature
+  table and then use the%SY+line command from the element selection list.
+
+  This feature is enabled by adding the following option to your optional
+  feature table:
+
+        ENHOPT%CD18104_SYNC_ACTION=ON+                  +DEFAULT IS OFF
