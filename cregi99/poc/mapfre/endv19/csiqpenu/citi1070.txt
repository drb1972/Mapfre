+  CD18107   End-to-End Package Logging by Action Feature
+
+  With this enhancement, you can now filter the Package Actions to be logged
+  and specify a different%TO PATH+in each Package Logging statement.
+  The updated Package logging syntax supports supplying a%FOR ACTIONS+
+  option, similar to the Element Logging syntax.
+  Included with this update is the addition of the%data set name/member name
+  or%path name/file name+as the result of an Add or Retrieve action in the
+  JSON format element action output.
+
+  Below is a%PACKAGE LOGGING+SCL example, coded in the%E2ELOGMBR+member:
+
+  PACKAGE LOGGING ON
+   %FOR ACTIONS (CREATE)
+    TO PATH "/u/users/endevor/1801/end2end/pkglog/CREATE/"
+  .
+  PACKAGE LOGGING ON
+   %FOR ACTIONS (CAST,APPROVE,DENY)
+    TO PATH "/u/users/endevor/1801/end2end/pkglog/CASTAPPDNY/"
+  .
+  PACKAGE LOGGING ON
+    TO PATH "/u/users/endevor/1801/end2end/pkglog/ALL/"
+  .
+
+  In the above example:
+   - Package%create+actions are logged to the%"CREATE"+path
+   - Package%cast/approve/deny+actions are logged to the%"CASTAPPDNY"+path
+   -%All other+actions are logged to the%"ALL"+path
+
+  Note that the ALL entry%does not include+the%FOR ACTIONS+option, therefore
+  any action that has not already been logged would be logged here. If the
+ %ALL entry+were not present or if logging was%OFF+for this statement, only
+  create, cast, approve and deny actions would be logged, logging would be
+  skipped for all other package actions.
