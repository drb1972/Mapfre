+  CD18108   Processor Utility Program CONMOVE
+
+  This enhancement introduces a new processor utility program CONMOVE.
+
+  This utility allows you to move output components from an element's
+  component list through the Endevor lifecycle and is generally intended for
+  MOVE processors.
+
+  The user syntax specified through the CONMVIN DD statement tells the
+  CONMOVE utility which output component data sets to process and which
+  target data set to copy that output component data set's members to. This
+  is done by matching the  component data set to the input statements
+  specified to obtain the target data set name of the copy operation. Input
+  statements are matched against the component data sets in the order in
+  which they are coded.
+
+  The CONMOVE utility only processes PDS/PDSE data sets found in an element's
+  component list. Output components such as ELIB data sets or USS files are
+  not supported by the CONMOVE utility.
+
+  The CONMOVE utility calls BSTCOPY to perform the copy operation. Up to 8
+  members at a time for a single data set are copied for each call to
+  BSTCOPY. If there are more than 8 members coming from the same component
+  data set, then multiple calls will be made to BSTCOPY to copy all of the
+  members. Each call to BSTCOPY only processes the members from a single
+  data set.
