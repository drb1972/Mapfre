+  CD19003   Endevor Text Search
+
+  This feature enables a full text search in the following interfaces:
+
+   %Quick Edit+Command 'ESEARCH' on the Element Selection List panel
+   %CSV Utility+WHERE TEXT clause on a LIST ELEMENT request
+   %Endevor API+New fields in the ALELM_RQ (list element) request block
+
+  The search can be performed on any of the following:
+
+      Element Source
+      Element History
+      Element Summary of Levels
+      Element Changes
+      Component List
+      Component List Summary of Levels
+      Component List History
+      Component List Changes
+
+  When performing the search, Endevor will need to access the content
+  of each element in the list. This can lead to significant resource
+  usage when the list includes a large number of elements, so narrowing
+  down the list using other criteria like map location, type or ccid
+  is recommended.
+
+  Any elements that cannot be accessed for security or other reasons
+  will be skipped and considered as not a match.
+
+  By default, only elements whose Type definition specifies
+  DATA FORMAT = TEXT are searched.
+  This can be changed using one of the text search options (specific to
+  each interface where the text search is available)
+
+  This feature is enabled by adding the following option to your optional
+  feature table:
+
+      ENHOPT%CD19003_TEXT_SEARCH=ON+                +DEFAULT IS OFF
