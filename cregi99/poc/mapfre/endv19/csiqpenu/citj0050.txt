+  CD19004   Improved Processor Group Selection List
+
+  This enhancement makes several improvements to the processor
+  group selection list.  For all processor group selection lists,
+  the panel heading lines display the name of the default processor
+  group for the type and indicate the default processor group
+  in the message column if it is in the list.
+
+  For a processor group selection list that is created from an element
+  action such as add, update, generate, create, edit or transfer,
+  the element name and the current processor group are shown in the
+  panel heading lines. The message column indicates if a processor group
+  in the list is the DEFAULT, CURRENT, or both (CURR/DFLT).
+
+  In addition, the ESORT, EONLY and Locate commands are now supported
+  in both the Quick Edit and Foreground classic processor group
+  selection list panels.
