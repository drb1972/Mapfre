+  CD19005   Extended Element Name Masking
+
+  This enhancement enables%extended masking+in the%Element Name field
+  on the Quick Edit Option Menu and the Classic Endevor interface.
+
+ %Standard name masking+allows only one wildcard character asterisk (*)
+  at the end of the search string or as the only character in the
+  search string (full wildcard).
+
+ %Extended name masking+has no restrictions on the placement of the
+  wildcard character asterisk in the search string. The asterisk does
+  not have to be placed at the end of the search string and multiple
+  asterisks within the search string are allowed.
+
+  For example, the specification of the search string%U*PD*,+which
+  would be invalid for standard masking, is valid in the Element Name
+  field because of extended masking. This search string would return
+  all elements that begin with U and contain the characters PD anywhere
+  else in the element name, such as UPD, U1PD2ATE, U123PDT or UABCDXPD.
+
+  Extended name masking has no effect on the use of placeholder
+  characters.
