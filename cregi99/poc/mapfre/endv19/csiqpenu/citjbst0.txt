+Use these fields to specify job card settings for batch jobs. Provide all
+job card parameters, including the job name, time, message parameters,
+remote print information, and any other standards in use at your site.
+
+On the%CREATE/MODIFY DESTINATION+panel, you can specify the job name with
+the symbol%$HOSTJNM+in the%REMOTE JOB STATEMENT INFORMATION+field. For
+example, specify the following in the first entry field: //$HOSTJNM JOB ...
+This symbol takes the remote job name from the host job. Therefore, the host
+and remote jobs execute with the same job name, which makes it easier for
+you to understand which host job relates to which remote job.
+
+If you want the remote job to execute on a different or specific system,
+include a /*ROUTE XEQ card so that the remote job execution occurs on the
+system you specify.
