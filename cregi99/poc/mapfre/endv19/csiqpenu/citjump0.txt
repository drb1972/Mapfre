+This field is used when a copy of an element being moved is found
+at a non-mapped stage between the FROM and TO locations of the Move.

+When this occurs, the REQ ELM JUMP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT field is checked
+in the system definition. If REQ ELM JUMP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT=Y, then you
+you must specify ACKNOWLEDGE ELM JUMP=Y for the Move to execute.

+Otherwise, the value in this field can be either Y or N.

+Whenever an element is jumped during a move, a message is issued
+informing you of this fact.
