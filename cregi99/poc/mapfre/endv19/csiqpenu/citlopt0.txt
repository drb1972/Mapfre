%Display List+- Indicates whether or not to display an element
+     list:  Y (yes) or N (no).  The default is Y.
+
%Apply List Filters+- Specify Y (yes) to display the list filter panel.
+     When N (no) is specified, the panel is not displayed and filters
+     are%not+applied.  The list filter panel allows you to enter
+     options to filter your element list.  Data entered for the
+     Apply List Filters option and panel is retained across sessions.
+
%Build Using Map+- Type Y (yes) if you want to search the map,
+     starting at the FROM location, when building a selection list.
%     Warning:+ Avoid using BUILD USING MAP = Y in combination with
+               DISPLAY LIST = N.
+
%Display SYS/SBS List+- Display action only. Indicates whether you
+     want to go directly to the Element Selection list from the
+     Display Elements panel. Y (yes), N (No). Default is N.
+
%First Found+- Retrieve action only. Indicates whether the Element
+     Selection list should include only the first occurrence of
+     specified elements found when searching the map. Y (yes), N (no).
+     The default is Y.
+
%Where Signout Eq+- Signin action only. Builds a list of elements
+     signed out to a specified user id. The default user id is the
+     current logon id.  Wildcarding is allowed without placeholders.
+
%Case-Sensitive Elm Name+- Indicates if the match on the Element name
+     should be case-sensitive. This field works with the%Uppercase+
+     field to build the element selection list.
%     Y+- Match on Element name exactly as coded after interpreting
+         the Uppercase field setting.
%     N+- Name entered is not case-sensitive. Regardless of the
+         Uppercase field setting and whether the value was entered
+         in upper, lower or mixed case, all element names that match
+         the mask are returned in the element selection list.
+         For example, entering an Element name of ABC*, abc*, AbC*,
+         or aBc* will return the same list of elements.
+
+     The initial value for this field is set from the%&LIT1         +
+     ENDICNFG Configuration Table parameter. Once the action
+     panel is displayed the value entered by the user is saved
+     and restored each time the panel is re-displayed.
+
+    %Note+-the%Uppercase+and the%Case-Sensitive Elm Name+fields are
+     hidden if the short layout is selected in the User
+     Defaults panel. (See User Defaults below for more information).
