+Certain actions such as the%ADD, Update+and%Retrieve+require the name
 of a%From+or%To+location in order to process the action.

 The location can be a PDS, Librarian or Panvalet library, a sequential
 file or a path and USS file. Enter the type of location and the desired
 data set or path/USS file name in the%From/To+location fields.

 Valid%Data Set Type(USS/ISPF)+values are:

   %D    +- PDS, Librarian or Panvalet library, a sequential file

   %U    +- Path and USS file
+
%Note:+Both USS and ISPF Dataset fields can store values. However, only
+      the value that corresponds to the Data Set Type (USS or Data Set)
+      is used. This allows users who regularly work with both types of
+      data to avoid having to re-key these fields. These users only
+      have to modify the Data Set Type option.
