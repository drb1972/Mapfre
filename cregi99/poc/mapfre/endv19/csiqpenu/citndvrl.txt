%Layout+- The layout of this panel is controlled by the
+    %LAYOUT (L-Long/S-Short)+option on the%User Defaults+panel.  If set
+     to%'L'+The element name field appears on top at the top of the panel
+     and allows for long-named Elements. If set to%'S'+, the Element name
+     field is limited to 10 characters and the options related to
+     long-named Elements, such as UPPERCASE, CASE SENSITIVE and USS path
+     and file names are hidden.
+
%Element+- The 1 to 255 character name of the element(s) you want to
+     process. You can enter 51 characters at a time in this field
+     or 10 characters if your layout option is set to 'SHORT'.
+     If the value is longer than the available space you can use the
+     scroll right PF key (usually PF11) to enter additional
+     characters. You can also enter the EXPAND primary command to
+     display an ISPF pop-up window where you can then enter the entire
+     Element name.
+
+     Extended element name masking is supported, which allows the
+     wildcard character asterisk (*) to be used multiple times in an
+     element name mask. For example, the specification U*PD* would
+     return all element names that begin with U and contain the
+     characters PD anywhere else in the element name, such as UPD,
+     U1PD2ATE, U123PDT or UABCDXPD.
+
+     Note: You can set up a PF Key Definition for the EXPAND
+     command by entering the KEYS command from within ISPF
+     and setting PFn...EXPAND.
+
+Certain actions such as the Transfer action support both a FROM and TO
+Element name. Enter a different Element name if you want to change the
+name of the Element at the target location. If you do not enter a TO
+Element name, the name defaults to the FROM location Element name.
+
%To Element+- The 1 to 255 character name of the Element at the target
+     location. You can enter 51 characters at a time in this field.
+     If the value is greater than 51 characters you can use the
+     scroll right PF key (usually PF11) to enter additional
+     characters. You can also enter the EXPAND command to display an
+     ISPF pop-up window where you can then enter the entire Element
+     name. Name masking is not supported.
+
%Uppercase+- Indicates if the name coded in the Element name fields
+     should be accepted as entered or uppercased. Applies to all
+     Element name fields on the panel, as in the case of the Transfer
+     action panel.
+    %Y+- Uppercase the value coded prior to processing the action.
+    %N+- Use the Element name exactly as coded.
+
+     The initial value for this field is set from the%&LIT1         +
+     ENDICNFG Configuration Table parameter. Once the action panel is
+     displayed the value entered by the user is saved and restored
+     each time the panel is re-displayed.
