%  JOB STATEMENT INFORMATION FIELDS+- Use these fields to enter
+    JOB card settings for JOBs submitted in batch.
+
%  SEL LIST ELEMENT COLUMN WIDTH+- Selection list Element or USS file
+    name column width. The range is 8 to 30. The initial value for
+    this field is set from the%&LIT1                 +ENDICNFG
+    Configuration Table parameter. Once the ISPF User Defaults
+    panel is displayed the value entered by the user is saved and
+    restored each time the panel is re-displayed.
+
%  LAYOUT (L-Long/S-Short)+- For users who do NOT make use of Long element
+    names, and do NOT need USS file support, set the option
+    to%'S'+for%Short.+ This option dynamically modifies the panel to keep
+    the element name in the earlier panel style and hides options they do
+    not need like Uppercase, Case Sensitive, and USS path and file names.
+    Use option%'L'+for%Long+to enable a layout with a long element name at
+    the top (followed by type, CCID and COMMENT where appropriate) and all
+    the mixed case and USS fields visible and active.
+
+    Each user can choose their preferred value but the system administrator
+    sets the site default via the%&LIT2         +ENDICNFG Configuration
+    Table parameter.
