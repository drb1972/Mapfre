%  Simulation mode+causes the actual execution of all actions in the batch job
+to be bypassed. No updates are performed. The C1MSGS1 and C1MSGS2 reports will
+show the Syntax Request report and Action Summary report as if the actions were
+executed. There will be a heading line, labeled%"*** AUTOGEN SIMULATION ***"+
+to indicate that the job ran in simulation mode. Use the reports for impact
+analysis to see what the results would be if the actions were performed.
+
+To activate simulation mode, append the%EN$AUSIM+DD statement to your batch
+job or use the%include JCL+option to add the DD statement.
+
+Example:
+ %//EN$AUSIM DD SYSOUT=*+
