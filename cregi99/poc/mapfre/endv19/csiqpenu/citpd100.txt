+    The Destination Selection List can be displayed from the Destination
+    Options Menu under the Environment Options Menu or from the Package
+    Shipment panel under the Package Foreground Options Menu Ship option.
+    When displayed from the Destination Options Menu all Destinations
+    defined in the package file are displayed. When displayed from the
+    Package Shipment panel, only the destinations that contain a%MAPS TO+
+    mapping rule that matches at least one of the package backout records
+    dataset/path names are displayed.
+
+    If none of the%EXCLUDE+or%MAPS TO+mapping rules match a backout
+    record data set or path name, then the data set or path name is
+    shipped to the remote site using the host name as the remote name.
+    In this case, the destination also appears on the Ship Destination
+    Selection List unless the%ENCOPTBL &LIT1                       +
+    optional feature is activated.
