%Promotion Package+- Promotion packages allow the package to be reused
+  without having to manually reset the package, edit the SCL and CAST
+  the package. At the time of a successful execution of a package, the
+  package will automatically be reset, the SCL will be updated to point
+  to the next location and the package will be CAST. Promotion packages
+  can only contain MOVE actions and all the actions must have the same
+  environment and stage id.
+  The PROMOTION PKG field defined on the Package Display panel indicates
+  whether the current package is a promotion package. Valid values are:
+   %Y+- The package is a promotion package.
+   %N+- The package is not a promotion package.
+
%Target Environment/Stage+- All the actions within a promotion package must
+  have the same target environment and stage id. This field contains the
+  target environment/stage name. It is populated as part of the CAST action.
+
%Target Fields Note+- The target environment and stage literals and
+  data fields will only appear on the display panel when data
+  exists for the package.                                     (%PF3+to return)
