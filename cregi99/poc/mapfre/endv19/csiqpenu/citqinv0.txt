%
+The software inventory structure allows you to:
+
%  Work+with program modules without having to know where they are
+     physically located, or how they are compiled.
%  List+all the program components that make up an application,
+     regardless of type.
%  Determine+the location(s) of an element simply by entering the
+     element name on a display screen.
%  Act+on a cross section of your program inventory.  For example,
+     you can list all COBOL code in your shop, or promote an entire
+     new release of the payroll application with a single command.
+     Selection lists can be produced, for example, of:
+       * All the JCL in the shop
+       * All the software currently in QA
+       * All the manufacturing software currently being unit tested
+
+There are many other ways to use this structure to your advantage.
