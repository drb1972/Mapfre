%Sync+- Indicates whether you want to Move or Transfer elements when
+   the base level of the element at the source location is different from
+   the current level of the element at the target. Acceptable values are:
+
%      N+- Default. Do not perform the Move or Transfer.
%      Y+- Perform the Move or Transfer
+
+   When you specify Y, a "sync" level is crated at the target location that
+   reflects the differences between the base level at the source location
+   and the current level at the target. The Move or Transfer fails if the
+   levels are different and you have specified SYNC=N.
+
+   You must specify%SYNC=Y+when moving or transferring an element that has
+   remained at a location after being moved or transferred using
+  %BYPASS ELEMENT DELETE=Y.
