+An inventory structure helps to manage the software life cycle by
+providing a consistent and flexible logical structure for classifying
+software inventory.
+
+There are six components to this inventory structure: environments,
+stages, systems, subsystems, types, and elements.
+
+Environments, stages, systems, subsystems, and types are set
+up by the product administrator. The actual inventory is made up of
+elements. Users act on elements.
