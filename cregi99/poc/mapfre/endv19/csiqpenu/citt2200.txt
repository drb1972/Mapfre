+Stage is the term for a stage in the software life cycle. For
+example, a site may have stages TEST, QA, FIX, and PROD in its life cycle.
+There must be two stages for each environment.
+
+Stages have a name, representing their place in the life cycle (for
+example TEST) and an ID (1 or 2). Stages are referred to as Stage 1
+(the first stage in an environment) and Stage 2 (the second stage
+in an environment).
+
+Stages are defined in the C1DEFLTS table. Stage information is
+displayed on the Stage Information panel.
+
+Stages can be linked together to establish unique promotion routes
+for program inventory within and between environments.  These routes
+make up the map for a site.
