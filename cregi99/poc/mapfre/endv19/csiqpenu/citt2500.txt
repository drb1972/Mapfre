+Type is the term for categories of source code. For example,
+you might create the following types: COBOL (for COBOL code);
+COPYBOOK (for copybooks); JCL(for JCL streams).
+You must define a type to each stage in which you want to use it.
+
+JCL streams, called processors, are used to automate creating
+executables.  You can associate a group of processors with each
+type.  Each processor group includes the processors needed for a
+particular type of source.  For example, the processor group for type
+COBOL might include processors for VS COBOL and COBOL II.
+
+You work with types on the Type Definition panel.
