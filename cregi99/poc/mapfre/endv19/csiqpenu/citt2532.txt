%Image delta format+- The element base is the current image of the
+   element. If you choose this format, no source compare is peformed
+   to determine changes.  Instead, each element level represents
+   a full image of the element. This format consumes more DASD storage
+   and should be restricted to elements such as USS binary executables and
+   machine-generated source where the source compare is impossible or
+   unnecessary. With this format, it is recommended that you keep the
+   "Remove/Consol at Level" number low.
+
+   Elements with either forward or reverse delta formats can change to
+   image delta format when moved (or transferred) without change history.
+   Likewise, elements with image deltas can change to forward or reverse
+   delta format when moved (or transferred) without history from one
+   location to another. Note, move with history is not permitted between
+   locations where one type format is image and the other is a different
+   type format.
