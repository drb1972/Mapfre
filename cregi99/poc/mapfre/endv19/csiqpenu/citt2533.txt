+  You can store the element base either as is or as encrypted and compressed.
+  If you store the element base as is:
+     * Source is directly readable by programs (compilers, search utilities).
+     * Base/delta format is the same as regular PDS format, eliminating the
+         need for source output libraries.
+     * List and query functions perform more efficiently.
+  If you store the element base in encrypted/compressed format:
+     * Compression provides DASD savings.
+     * Encryption allows a single base library to contain multiple
+         elements with the same name, but different system, subsystem,
+         or type specifications.
