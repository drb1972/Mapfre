+Element is the term for PDS members, Panvalet or Librarian, or
+sequential data sets that have been added to the software inventory.
+The element name defaults to the member name.
+
+Elements are classified according to the inventory structure you
+set up. Each element is described uniquely in terms of its:
+
+  * Location in the software life cycle. This is determined by the
+      environment and stage where it resides.
+
+  * Inventory classification. This is determined by the system,
+      subsystem, and type with which it is associated.
