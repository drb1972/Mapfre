+  The Generate action is affected only if the COPYBACK option is specified.
+  COPYBACK causes the environment map to be searched for a copy of
+  the element requested for generation.  For example, you can generate
+  with copyback into a test stage, even if the element to be generated
+  generated resides in a different environment in the environment map.
+  The element will be copied to the target stage before invoking the
+  generate processor.
