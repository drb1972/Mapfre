+When the map is searched during an action, and the element is found
+at a location other than the current location, the action fails if
+that element is not signed out to the user requesting the action.
+
+Before requesting an action that uses the map, make sure that
+the element(s) involved in the action are signed out to you at
+all locations on the map route used by the action.
+
+For example, if you try to Add element PROG01 to Stage 1 of
+environment DEV, but PROG01 is signed out to another user in
+environment PROD, your Add request will fail.
