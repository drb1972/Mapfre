+Footprints are used to ensure source is synchronized with executables
+by comparing the date and time when the element was last generated
+(from the Master Control File) with the footprint date and time.
+
+You can utilize this capability by:
+
+  * Including FOOTPRNT=VERIFY in processors. This automates footprint
+    verification whenever the processor runs. See Chapter 5 in the
+    Administrator's Guide.
+
+  * Utilizing Footprint reports on a regular basis. See the Reports
+    manual for examples of these reports and instructions for
+    producing them.
