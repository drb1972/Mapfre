+Footprints let you display the following:
+
+  * A list of members in a library, with footprint information for each.
+
+  * A list of CSECTs for a specified load module, with footprint
+    information for each CSECT and for the load module.
+
+If a member, CSECT, or load module is footprinted, you can display its
+element information (current source, change history, changes at the
+current level, summary of levels, and Master Control File information)
+from this selection list. For source-less elements, you can only display
+the Master Control File information.
+
+For more information on how to display source information from a list of
+executables using footprints, see "View Footprint Information" in the
+chapter "Viewing Inventory Component Information" in the User's Guide.
