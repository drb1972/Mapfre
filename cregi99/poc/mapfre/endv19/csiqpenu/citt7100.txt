+Creating a package involves:
+
+  * Identifying the elements to be included in the package.
+  * Building a file of actions to be performed against the elements.
+  * Identifying the package as standard or emergency.
+  * Specifying dates between which the package must be executed.
+
+You can also create a package by reusing an existing package.
