+If component validation is active, each component list associated with
+an element referenced in a MOVE action is checked.  The package CAST
+will be disallowed (CAST will fail) if any input components:
+ * Reside at the same stage as the source of the Move action and
+     have not been included in the package.  In this case, commented
+     MOVE SCL is appended for the omitted input component.
+ * Are missing or have been modified (the time stamp in the component
+     list footprint does not correspond to either the Generate or Move
+     time stamp in the MCF) since the element was generated.  Error
+     messages are issued when this condition occurs.
+
+When a cast fails for either of these reasons, review the package and
+do one of the following:
+ * Generate the element to pick up the latest version of a component.
+ * Cast the package without validation (if allowed).
+ * Cancel the package if a component has been deleted.
+
+For more information, see Chapter 7 of the User's Guide.
