+The C1DEFLTS Table contains a flag*PKGCSEC*that indicates whether
+actions should be checked at package cast time, to determine if
+the person casting the package has the authority to perform all
+actions contained in that package.
+
+If PKGCSEC=Y, each action is checked in the package. If the person
+is not authorized to perform all actions, he/she cannot cast the
+package.  If PKGCSEC=N, no security checks are performed.
