+A package must be reviewed if one or more approver groups are associated
+with the inventory area(s) included in the package.  Once a package is
+in the review phase, only designated approvers can access the package
+and review its contents.  If the Dynamic Approvers option is enabled
+in the Optional Feature table, package approvers can add additional
+users as one-time approvers for a particular package while it is in
+the 'In-Approval' state.
+
+To be approved, a package must:
+  * Receive approval from at least the required approvers.
+  * Receive approval from a quorum of approvers.
+  * Not be denied approval by any approvers
+
+Example: The approver group PKGQA consists of three approvers. The
+  approver group was established with a quorum size of 2, with one
+  approver required.  This means that in addition to the required
+  approver, one of the two remaining members of the approver group
+  must approve the package in order for it to be executed.
