+Package backout is designed to restore load modules and other
+executables to their pre-package execution state. Backout does not
+restore the source to its previous image, because the "bad" source is
+the audit trail of the change. This audit trail should not be
+disrupted for any reason, because it allows you to view change history
+and changes only online, facilitating problem resolution.
+
+It is known that the executables have been backed out even if the
+source isn't, by flagging the element in the MCF.  Users are warned when
+they subsequently retrieve the backed-out element, that the element has
+been backed out.
+
%Note:+If you want to restore the prior level of source, you can do so
+  online using the Summary of Levels panel on the Retrieve action. The
+  prior level of source, after retrieval, can then be added back, creating
+  a new change level and preserving the audit trail of the bad change.
