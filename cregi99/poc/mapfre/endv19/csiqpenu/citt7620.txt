+As with package commitment, package backout and backin takes into
+consideration dependencies between packages.

+Assume you execute package PKG1, containing elements COPYA, COPYB,
+COPYC, and COPYF. You then execute package PKG2, also containing
+element COPYF, as well as COPYD and COPYE.

+You then decide to back out PKG1. Because the execution of PKG2 has
+affected element COPYF, which is in both packages, you must back out
+PKG2 first. Otherwise, COPYF will not be returned to its original,
+pre-execution state.
