+Indicates whether you want to move the element with history. By default,
+elements move without history. This means that all change levels
+at the source location are combined into a single level and appended
+to the current level at the target location.

+When you specify WITH HISTORY=Y, all change levels are moved from
+the source to the target location and appends them to the current level
+at the target.
