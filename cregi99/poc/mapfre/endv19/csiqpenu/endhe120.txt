+The inventory location fields specify the location where the search
+begins for a specified element.
+
$Environment+- The environment associated with the element.
+
$System+- The system associated with the element.
+
$Subsystem+- The subsystem associated with the element.
+
$Type+- The type associated with the element.
+
$Element+- The name of the element, with support for up to a 255
+  character name or mask.
+
+ $Extended masking+is available for specifying the element name to
+  generate an element list. An asterisk (*) wildcard character
+  represents 0 or more characters and a percent (%) exactly 1
+  character. The * and % characters can be used multiple times and can
+  be placed anywhere within the element name mask.
+
+  For example, the element name mask specification$*a*%b+will match any
+  element name that contains an 'a' in any position that is followed by
+  at least 1 of any character which is then followed with 'b' as the
+  last character. An element name of at least 3 characters is required
+  to match this mask.
+
+  The$Case-sensitive Elm Name+and$Uppercase Elm Name+settings are
+  always honored, including for extended masking.
+
$Uppercase Elm Name+- When this option is set to$Y,+the element name is
+  uppercased before any list or action processing takes place. When
+  displaying the selection list, the argument to the$LOCATE (L)+command
+  is uppercased. Set this field to$N+if you do not want uppercasing to
+  occur.
+
$  Note+- The$Uppercase+and$Case-Sensitive Elm Name+fields are hidden if
+  the short layout is selected in the User Defaults panel.
