%Case-sensitive Elm Name+- This field is used with the%Uppercase+field to
+  build the element selection list. If the Uppercase field is set to%Y,+
+  the element name or mask is uppercased and then this field is used to
+  determine case-sensitivity when building the element selection list. If
+  this field is set to%Y,+the element names are presented in the element
+  selection list using exactly what is specified in the element name or
+  mask. If this field is set to%N,+both upper and lower case element names
+  are presented in the list based on the element name or mask regardless of
+  the case of the characters that are specified.
+
+  This field affects the execution of the%LOCATE (L)+command only when the
+ %Uppercase+field is set to%N.+ When the Uppercase field is set to%N+and
+  this field is set to%Y,+the LOCATE command argument is used exactly as
+  specified to locate the element in the selection list. When the Uppercase
+  field is set to%N+and this field is set to%N,+two locates may be
+  performed to position the selection list. For the first locate, the
+  command argument is used exactly as specified. If an exact match is found
+  for the characters specified in the argument, locate processing stops and
+  the list is displayed at the new position. If an exact match is NOT found
+  for the characters specified in the argument, a second and final locate
+  is performed with the argument uppercased.
+
%  Note+- The%Uppercase+and%Case-Sensitive Elm Name+fields are hidden if the
+  short layout is selected in the User Defaults panel.
