+The Action Options fields allow you to further define your
+action request.
+
%CCID+- The CCID associated with this request. The CCID must
+   conform to CCID syntax rules.
+
%Comment+- The comment associated with this request. Comments can
+   be up to 40 characters and cannot include imbedded single
+   quotation marks.
+
%Processor Group+- The processor group to be associated with the
+   element. If you do not specify a group, the default processor for
+   the type will be assigned.  See the User's Manual for information.
+
%Preserve VB Record Length+- Valid values are Y and N.  If Y is
+   specified, the trailing spaces of any record in a variable record
+   edit session will be preserved. If N is specified, the trailing
+   spaces will be removed. This option is applicable only when
+   either the Element RECFM in the type definition is set to Variable
+   or it is set to Not Defined and Endevor automatically detects the
+   record format as variable.
+
+   Endevor automatically detects the record format as fixed when
+   creating a new element, or when the length of all records in an
+   existing element is equal to the Source Element Length defined in
+   the type. Otherwise, Endevor automatically detects the record
+   format as variable.
