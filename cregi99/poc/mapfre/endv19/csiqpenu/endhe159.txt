%    The SQ Command+is used to manage the request queue and perform actions
+       with the queue.  Entering the command%SQ+alone will bring up the
+       job submit confirmation panel, where you can press ENTER to submit
+       all currently queued requests, or one of the following commands
+       to perform alternative options.
+
+       The available SQ commands are;
%          BLANK   +or%SUB+To submit the queue, using the current
+                   JOB card options
+
%          CANCEL  +To reset the queue (discarding any pending requests)
+                   and exit.
+
%          EDIT    +To invoke an EDIT session where you can edit or modify
+                   the requests.
+
%          EDITJCL +To invoke an EDIT session with the Endevor Batch JCL
+                   expanded along with your SCL.  Use this option if you
+                   need to add custom JCL statements or just want to save
+                   off a copy of JCL for use later.
+                   Note: If you do this, you should use the EDIT SUB
+                   command to submit the JCL.
+
%          VALIDATE+or%VAL+to validate the SCL syntax of requests in the
+                   Queue. If there are any syntax errors a report is shown.
+
%          NEW     +To invoke an EDIT session with NO CONTENT so you can
+                   add your own SCL.  For example using the%MODel+command.
+
%          BUILD   +or%BLD <ACTION>+to Build "ACTION" SCL for all elements
+                   in the current element selection list.
+                   The generated SCL is built using%&&&&ACTION ELEment+
+                   commands so you can easily change the request to any
+                   valid request; MOVe, TRAnsfer, etc.  If the optional
+                   parameter%<ACTION>+is omitted, the default is Generate.
+                   SET OPTION SCL is inserted as appropriate from the
+                   ACTION OPTIONS depending on the request.
+
+    If you use%END+to leave Quick Edit, with active requests pending, you
+    will be prompted to either%SUBMIT+the requests or%CANCEL+to Discard them.
+
+    Note: The%SQ+command can be entered with an optional parameter, the
+          sub-command. For example, use%SQ SUB+to bypass the confirmation
+          panel and just submit the job, or%SQ ED+to Edit the SCL requests.
+
+
+                                 (Press}END+to return)
