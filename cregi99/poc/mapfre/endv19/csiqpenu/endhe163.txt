%  The Quick Edit SY line command+is used to initiate a%"SYNC in PLACE"
+  action to mark a resolved%"out-of-sync"+as completed and rebuild
+  the element deltas appropriately.
+
+  This option works only in case where%CD18104_SYNC_ACTION+feature
+  is turned on.
+
+  The SY command will display a panel asking the user to confirm they
+  have already fixed any source code conflicts between the element and its
+  next version up the map, and allowing them to select the following options:
+
+ %CCID+- The CCID associated with this request. The CCID must
+     conform to CCID syntax rules.
+
+ %Comment+- The comment associated with this request. Comments can
+     be up to 40 characters and cannot include imbedded single
+     quotation marks.
+
+ %Override Signout+- Indicates whether you can synchronize this
+     element when it has been signed out to a user other than
+     yourself.
+
+       %Y+- Override the current signout and allow access to the
+            element.
+       %N+- (Default). Do not override the current signout.
+
+ %With History+- Indicates whether change levels of the element
+     should be kept.
+
+       %Y+- Keep all change levels of the element.
+
+       %N+- Keep only the latest change level.
+
+ %Generate after Sync+- Indicates whether the element will be
+     generated after the synchronization.
+
+       %Y+- Generate the element after synchronization.
+
+       %N+- Do not generate the element.
+
+ %Generate Action Mode+- Indicates whether the generate action
+     should be executed in foreground or batch.
+
+       %F+- Execute the generate in the foreground session.
+
+       %B+- Submit a batch job to execute the generate action.
+
+ %Caution+
+
+  The intended usage of this feature in Quick Edit is for elements whose
+  source code has already been corrected (manually or by an outside tool),
+  and any changes from up the map were merged into the element version
+  being synchronized. Using the sync in place without making sure that
+  the source code has been correctly merged can result in code changes
+  getting reverted once the element is moved up the map.
+
+ %Note+
+
+  The element levels created by a sync in place match the levels obtained
+  by using a Move/Transfer action with Sync option as closely as possible.
