+This screen is shown when Endevor cannot determine in which specific target
+inventory location the Edit or Generate action should be performed.
+This can happen when:
+ - The element selection list was built using wildcards in one or more
+   of the Environment, System and Subsystem fields, AND
+ - More than one inventory location maps to the element that was selected
+   for the Edit or Generate action.
+
+On this screen, you can enter fully or partially wildcarded values in any or
+all of the Environment, System and/or Subsystem fields or leave them blank.
+
+Endevor uses the input on this screen to select possible target locations
+that map to the selected element. If more than one target location exists you
+will be prompted to select a specific location.
