+Use the%Element Selection List+to select an element for action processing
+or to display element information.
+
+Request an action against or display information about an element by typing
+one of the specified options next to the element name in the selection list.
+
+Select more than one element for processing by specifying a processing
+option for up to as many elements as appear on the screen. The options
+specified do not have to be the same. The dialog processes the elements
+in the order in which they appear in the selection list.
+
+The list can be filtered further using the%EONLY+and%ESEARCH+commands,
+and the sort order can be changed using the%ESORT+command.
+
+While displaying an element selection list, enter the%Action Options+panel
+by entering%AO+on the command line. The Action Options panel allows the
+setting of options for the actions to be processed, including Override
+Signout, CCID and Comment. The action options must be updated before
+specifying any options in the selection list. Any options specified in the
+selection list are processed before the Action Options panel is displayed.
+
+Submit Queue:%SQ+- Invoke the Submit/Show Queue command to work with pending
+batch requests when the%AO+(Action Option), Queue actions for Batch, is
+Enabled.  From the confirmation panel you can then Submit, Edit or Cancel
+the requests.
