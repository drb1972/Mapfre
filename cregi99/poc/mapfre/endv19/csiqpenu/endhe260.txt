+Use the Summary of Element Levels panel to edit a particular level
+of an element, display a particular level, or to display the
+changes or change history for a particular level of an element.
+
+Note that although option "M" (Master) can be specified for any change
+level, the displayed information is associated with the last level.
+
+Request an action against an element level by typing the requisite
+option letter to the left of the desired version and level.
+For example, to edit level 0103 of an element, type%E+to the left
+of 0103 in the VVLL column.
+
+You can select more than one level for processing, and specify
+a different processing option for each level. The dialog
+processes the levels in the order in which they appear in
+the selection list.
+
+The summary of levels selection list occupies two screens, so the LEFT
+and RIGHT scroll commands or the default F keys can be used to scroll
+from screen 1 to screen 2 or vice versa. Repeated left or right
+scrolling will result in recycling of the screens.
+
+To initiate processing, press%ENTER+.
