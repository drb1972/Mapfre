+Use the Element Selection List to select an element that you wish
+to copy, or compare with, the element you are editing.
+
+Select an element by placing an%'CO'+in the selection field next to
+the desired element. Only one element can be selected from this list.
+If you select more than one element, the first element is copied and
+any subsequent selected elements are ignored.
+
+To initiate the COPYELM processing, press%ENTER+.
+
+By default, selecting an element will return the current version.  To
+select a prior level, use option%'S'+to return a summary list for the
+Element, and then%'CO'+to pick a particular version.
+
+You can also use%'B'+to Browse the element,%'C'+for changes,%'H'+for
+history, or%'M'+to display the element master, in order to confirm the
+element you are selecting the element/version you need.
+
+If you specify an element name on the%COPYELM+or%COMPELM+command, or
+use the%NEXT+or%ALL+keywords, then the Element filter panel(ENDIE900)
+will be bypassed.  This allows you to 'fast-path' a copy or compare
+request. In this case you can use PF3 to return to it, if you need to
+add or adjust your search criteria.
+
+You can also use the special character%'='+to stand in for the current
+element name or type, for example%"COPYELM = JCL"+will use the current
+element name and set the TYPE to JCL and skip the filter environment
+confirmation panel.
