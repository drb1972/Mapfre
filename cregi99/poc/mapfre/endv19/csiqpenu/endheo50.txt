%   Layout (L-Long/S-Short)+- For users who do NOT make use of long
+     Element names, and do NOT need USS file support, set the option to
+    %S+for short.  This option formats the panel in the earlier panel
+     style and hides options these users do not need.
+     Use option%L+for long for users who want a panel layout that can
+     display a long Element name at the top (followed by type, CCID and
+     COMMENT).  The related options%Uppercase Elm Name,+and
+    %Case-sensitive Elm Name+are visible and active.  The initial
+     value for this field is set from the%&LIT1        +ENDICNFG
+     Configuration Table parameter.
+     Once the User Defaults panel is displayed the value entered by the
+     user is saved and restored each time the panel is re-displayed.
