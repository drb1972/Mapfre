+The Archive to Data Set Name fields identify the data set to which the package
+definition is to be archived.  They are standard ISPF data set specification
+fields used to identify an external data set and member.
+
+Use the Other Sequential Data Set field as an alternative to the Archive Data
+Set Name fields to identify an external data set and member.  Type the data
+set and member specification in 'data set(member)' format.
+
+The archive package file must be defined with variable length records and
+have a minimum record length of 4200. The data set blocksize must be 4 bytes
+greater than the record length. We recommend that you define a blocksize
+of 0 and let the system set the optimum block size.
