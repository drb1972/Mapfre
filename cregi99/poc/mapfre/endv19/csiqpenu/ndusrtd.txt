%DiffTool - Compare any two elements+
+
+  These sample user routine (NDUSRXD*) allows the user to select any two
+  elements and invoke a compare between them.
+
%  Intended Use:+
+  Use these routines to quickly compare an element with any prior version,
+  in the current environment, or at any other location on the map.  Rows can
+  be selected from the Summary of levels, or the element selection list on
+  any split screen.
+
+  Supported Line commands:
%  D    +On its own, selects an element or version to compare.
%       +When two elements have been selected, compare is invoked.
%  DN   +Use DN to select the%"NEW"+version to compare.
%  DO   +Use DO to select the%"OLD"+version.
%  DU   +Compare this element with the next version of the element%Up+the map.
%  DP   +Compare this element with the%Production+(top of the map) version.
+
%  Note:+
+  This routine invokes IBM(R) Super/C to perform the actual compare. To
+  check or modify the compare options use command%EDIFopt.  You can also
+  use this panel to adjust the allocation parameters of the temporary files
+  if needed to accommodate special needs (e.g. record length, or formatting).
