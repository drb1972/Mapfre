%Submit - Submit current Element for batch processing
+
+  This sample user routine (NDUSRSU) retrieves the selected element to
+  a temporary file and then issues a SUBMIT command for it. The submitted
+  job name and number are returned in the ISPF message.
+
%  Intended Use:+
+  If the element contains simple JCL, for example a test case, instead of
+  having to invoke (E) to Edit it and then issue the SUBmit command you
+  Can just submit it directly using the%SU+line command.
+  Use this routine to assist when building and user routines that require
+  a copy of the source element.
+
%  Note:+
+  Use this routine as an example when building and user routines that require
+  a copy of the source element, for example custom edit, print, routines etc.
