+   The Package Execution Utility is used to execute development
+   packages to either (or/both):-
+   a) Move USS processed elements (EAR, DEPLOY,WSDL,XSD)
+   b) Move elements with components to be shipped to the Mplex
+   for implementation in to test streams.
+
+   A job named F0<trackerid> will be submitted to execute the
+   development package.
+
+  %JOB RESTARTS
+   The PACKAGE execution steps in the F0* job can be restarted by
+   simply submitting the entire job via the Package Execution Utility.
+
+   The SHIPMENT step can be restarted by entering a 'Y' in the
+  %"Restart From Shipment Step..:" field.
+
+   A scheduling environment directs a job to an Lpar with the required
+   resources, e.g. DB2. It will also select the Lpar that is the least
+   utilised.
+   Sometimes there is no single schedule environment that satisfies
+   all the resources required so you must select an Lpar individually.
+   In this case go into the SE option in SDSF, look at the scheduling
+   environments that you need and select a common Lpar (or system as
+   it is referred to on the SE screen).
