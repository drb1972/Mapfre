+
+This option causes the Merge Output option to perform element synchronization
+on the element target location with the Root element before creating the
+derivation change levels.
+
+Before PDM performs a merge into CA Endevor SCM, the target location is
+checked to determine if the element already exists at this location. If it is
+found to exist at this location, then it is checked to determine if it is at
+the same source level as the Root or that its last level timestamp is equal to
+that of DV1. If neither of these criteria are met, and the synchronization
+options is not specified, then the PDM merge action fails.
+
+To force the failed merge, you can use the synchronization option. PDM will
+create a change level that sets the element's source back to the Root's.
+This change level, called the "sync level", will inherit the Root's CCID,
+Comment, Userid, Date and Time. After the synchronization, derivation change
+levels are created.
+
+To invoke this option:
+  - Use the SYNC NDVR OUTPUT Merge option in batch mode.
+  - Set the Merge Option SYNC field to 'Y' in foreground mode.
