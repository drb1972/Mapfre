%TUTORIAL \-\ Element up the map from PDM's Endevor Target  \-\ TUTORIAL
%SELECTION ===>_ZCMD
+
+When a same-named element exists up the map from the PDM Merge Endevor target
+location, a compare will be done to determine if that element's last level
+is equal to the DV1 element used during the WIP process. If so, a change level
+containing DV2 modifications will be created after the element is fetched back
+to the Merge target location. If not equal, a synchronization check will be
+performed between that element and the Root. If the element is in-sync with
+the Root, the element will be fetched back to the Merge target location.
+Change levels will be created for each of the derivations found in the WIP
+file. Each change level will inherit the derivation's CCID, Comment,
+Userid, Date and Time.
+
+If the element is found out-of-sync with the Root, the PDM Merge Output
+process will terminate. After a failure, you should examine the causes to
+determine the appropriate action. If you still want to perform the merge
+you can use the Merge Output SYNC option. This will create a sync change
+level after the element is fetched back. This sync level will bring the
+element's source back to the same level as the Root element.
