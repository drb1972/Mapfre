+PDM uses the type definition to determine the compare
+columns for WIP processing. If the Root element is taken from an
+inventory location, PDM uses the Compare Columns specified on the
+Element Type definition for the element. If the Root, Derivation 1, or
+Derivation 2 location is an external dataset, PDM validates the external
+data set record length (LRECL) against the Compare THROUGH value.
+If the compare THROUGH value is larger than the record length, PDM
+issues an error message and terminates processing.
