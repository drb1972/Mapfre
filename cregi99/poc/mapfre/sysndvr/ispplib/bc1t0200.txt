+The PDM User Defaults panel allows you to override defaults for space
+allocation of work areas and temporary data sets that are used in
+foreground. The defaults remain in effect until you change them,
+either in this particular session or in a subsequent work session.
+
+Allocation information is initially taken from the settings in the
+C1DEFLTS Table.  The PDM User Defaults panel allows you to override
+those default values for your user ID only.
