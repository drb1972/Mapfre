+If PDM is executing on an MVS/XA or MVS/ESA system (MVS/SP version 2
+or greater), PDM will use virtual storage as a work area during certain
+build and merge operations. If the WIP, Root, or derivation files are
+extremely large, PDM may exhaust the available virtual storage and the
+build or merge action will fail.
+
+This field controls whether PDM will use external (disk) storage instead
+of virtual storage during build and merge processing. Specify%Y+if PDM
+is to use external storage for its work area. Specify%N+if PDM is to us
+use virtual storage.%N+is the default.
+
+When PDM processing issues error message PDM2001E, and the corrective
+action for this message does not correct the problem, set the value
+in this field to%Y+.
