+When a command can use parameters, the acceptable values are!R+to specify
+a Root file,!1+to specify a Derivation 1 file, and!2+to specify a
+Derivation 2 file.
+
+For example, to use the WIPSHOW command to display records for the
+Root and Derivation 2 files, you would type!WIPSHOW R 2+
+
+When you specify more than one file in a command, the command executes
+against lines that include identifiers for any or all of the specified
+files. For example, when you issue the command!WIPLDEL 1 2+the WIPLDEL
+command will logically delete lines that were inserted from the Derivation
+1 file (%I-1), the Derivation 2 file (%I-2), or both files (% I-1,2).
+
+When you specify one file in a command, the command executes against lines
+that include the specified identifier. For example, when you issue the
+command!WIPLDEL 1+the WIPLDEL command will logically delete lines that
+were inserted from the Derivation 1 file (%I-1), or both files (%I-1,2)
