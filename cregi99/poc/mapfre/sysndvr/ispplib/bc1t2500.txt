+The WIP Member Selection Matrix:
+
+ * Identifies the WIP, Root, Derivation 1 and (when NUMBER OF DERIVATION
+      FILES=2) Derivation 2 libraries or inventory locations.
+ * Displays the member or element names within the Root, Derivation 1
+      and Derivation 2 libraries or inventory locations next to their
+      corresponding WIP member names. A%~+next to an element name indicates
+      that PDM will use a previous version/level to build the WIP file.
+
+The matrix allows you to view and manipulate Root and derivation members
+or elements prior to invoking the Build WIP process. Use the PF8 and PF7
+keys to scroll through the matrix. Type%QUIT+in the COMMAND field and
+press ENTER to exit the matrix.
