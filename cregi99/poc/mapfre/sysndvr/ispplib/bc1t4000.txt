+Use this panel to specify one or more WIP members to be merged. Do this
+by first specifying the library containing the WIP member, using
+standard ISPF naming conventions.
+
+You can type an explicit member name, an asterisk ( * ), or a name mask
+in the MEMBER field.  When you press ENTER, the Merge Output Specification
+Panel appears. This panel will ask you if you want the merged output to
+go into a file or to be placed as an element in CA Endevor SCM. Depending
+on your response, the proper Merge Output specification panel opens.
