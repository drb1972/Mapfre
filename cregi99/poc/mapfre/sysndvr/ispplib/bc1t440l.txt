+PDM displays the Merge Output Member Selection List when you leave the
+MEMBER field blank or provide an overlay mask on the Merge Output Specification
+panel. PDM builds the list using the members in the WIP library.
+
+To select a member, tab to the line where the member name appears and
+type%S+next to the member name. You can select multiple WIP file
+members at one time.
+
+When you press ENTER the Merge process is invoked for all selected members.
+When the Merge process has been completed for a member, the message
+*MERGED appears in the RENAME field next to each member.
+
+If you are using batch mode, the message *WRITTEN appears rather than
+*MERGED, indicating that the appropriate batch request control
+statements have been written. The actual merge does not take place
+until the requests are submitted for processing.
