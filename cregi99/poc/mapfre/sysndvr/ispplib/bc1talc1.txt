%Directory Block+- Must be numeric. If you specify a WIP member, you
+   must provide a non-zero value in this field. If you want to allocate
+   a sequential data set, this value must be zero.
+
%Record Format+- Acceptable values are%F, FB, V,+or%VB+.
+
%Record Length+- Must be numeric, greater than zero, and less than 255.
+   See also the note at the bottom of the WIP Data Set Allocation Panel.
+
%Block Size+- Required if the space unit is%BLKS+(blocks). Otherwise
+   optional. If left blank, the block size is set to zero. If provided
+   the value must be numeric and greater than zero. If the block size
+   is specified and is not zero, and if the record format is:
+
%     F+or%FB+    Then the block size must be an integral multiple
+                 of the record length.
%     V+or%VB+    Then the block size must be at least four bytes
+                 larger than the record length.
