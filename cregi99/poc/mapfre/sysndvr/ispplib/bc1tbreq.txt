+Use the%Batch Specification+fields on the PDM Primary Option Panel to
+specify a data set for storing PDM batch requests.
+
%Batch Request Data Set+- The batch request data set must be either a
+   sequential data set or a partitioned data set with an explicitly
+   identified member. The data set can contain either fixed or variable
+   length records. For fixed length records, the LRECL must be 80. For
+   variable length records, the LRECL must be 84.
+
%Other Partitioned or Sequential Data Set+- Use as an alternative area
+   for specifying the request data set, using standard ISPF conventions.
+
%Append or Replace+- Required. Specify%R+if PDM is to replace like-named
+   members in the request data set, or%A+if PDM is to append the
+   statements to an existing data set.
+
+The batch request data set can be dynamically allocated if the data set
+specified is not catalogued.
