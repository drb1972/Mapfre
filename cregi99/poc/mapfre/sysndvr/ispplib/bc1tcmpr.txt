%Compare Columns+- Required. Indicates the columns to be compared (FROM and
+   THROUGH), during the Build WIP operation.
+
+   It is very important that you specify the correct compare column
+   values for the data you are processing.
+
+   For example, columns 1-6 of a COBOL program usually contain
+   sequence numbers.  You should therefore specify a compare range of
+   columns 7-72 for COBOL code.  PDM will then build the WIP file
+   based on the contents of columns 7 through 72.

+   Likewise, if the Root is an assembler program, the compare
+   range should be columns 1-72.
