+the last sequenced row of the WIP Member Selection Matrix. PDM allows
+you to move these unmatched members into different matrix rows.

+To move the member, tab to the member name you want to move and type
+the sequence number of the row to which you want to move the member
+name, then press ENTER.  If the member being moved is replacing an
+existing member, PDM moves the old member to the first open slot in the
