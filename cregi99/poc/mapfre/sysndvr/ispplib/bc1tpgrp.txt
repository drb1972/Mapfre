+Through this field you can associate a processor group name to the
+element when PDM places it in its target CA Endevor SCM location.

+If you do not provide a processor group name, one is selected for you.
+
+  1) When the element is at the target location prior to the PDM merge,
+     the element will inherit the group name from that element.
+  2) When the element is not at the target location but exists up the
+     map, the element will inherit that element's processor group
+     name.
+  3) The element type definition's default processor group name will
+     be used when the element cannot be found along its destination
+     route.
