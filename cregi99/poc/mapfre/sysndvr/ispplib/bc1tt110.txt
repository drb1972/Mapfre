+Simple parallel development is the concurrent and independent
+development of applications by different programmers within the same
+company. In most simple parallel development situations,
+modifications are minimal and conflicts are few or nonexistent.
+Managerial intervention is rarely required. Most of the time the
+developers themselves can determine the time needed to make the
+necessary changes.
+
+Problem: Two programmers have been independently enhancing a report
+generation program. Potential conflicts and overlaps need to be
+identified and resolved and the program modifications must be
+integrated before the program is placed into production.
