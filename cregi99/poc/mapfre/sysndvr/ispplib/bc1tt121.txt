+Complex parallel development occurs in situations such as these:
+
+ * A company must maintain an existing software release while developing
+     a new release. One team of developers must continue to write
+     maintenance against an existing release, while another team
+     works on the new release. Eventually, the maintenance changes must
+     be incorporated in the next release.
+ * A company has multiple sites that are doing development at the same time.
+     For example, a state university with several campuses may be
+     upgrading its admissions tracking program. Two of the campuses are
+     making modifications that will eventually need to be integrated
+     into the existing admissions tracking program.
+
+Problem: Modified copies of a program must be integrated to produce a single
+updated package. In complex parallel development situations the potential
+for conflict tends to be higher, and the changes more difficult. Management
+intervention is usually required to plan the project and allocate resources.
