+Vendor products, such as proprietary or in-house developed products,
+need to be maintained and updated on a regular basis.  Whether you
+have purchased a vendor package that was customized by the vendor
+before delivery, or customized the package yourself, you need to
+integrate periodic vendor updates into the modified vendor code.

+Problem: The customizations to the basic product must be indentified
+and carried forward into the new release.
