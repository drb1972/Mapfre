+PDM builds a%Work-In-Process (WIP)+file by comparing the Root and
+one or two Derivations. The WIP File is an annotated intermediate
+that identifies the insertions and deletions made in each of
+the Derivations, as well as the insertions and deletions common
+to both. Potential insert conflicts are also identified.
+
+PDM creates a%Merge Output File+or a%CA Endevor SCM Merge Output Element+
+from a WIP file by performing all the annotated insertions and
+deletions, and then removing all the WIP annotation information.
+
+The%Statistics File+is an optional file that can be created when the
+Build WIP or Merge function is run. This file contains statistics,
+such as the number of insertions or deletions, the size of insert
+and delete blocks, complexity factor, inventory location, and so on.
+
+This file can be used as input to a report package, such as SAS.
