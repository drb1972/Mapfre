+A%Conflict Area+is a place in the WIP File where a conflict occurs.
+A conflict area involves at least two records: one record (line)
+from Derivation 1 and one from Derivation 2.
+
+A%Contention Area+is a place in the WIP File where conflicting changes
+exist, but are offset. This means that both Derivations have changed
+a section of code, but the changes do not begin at exactly the same place
+in the (Derivation) copies of the program.
+
+The%WIP Selection Matrix+is a PDM screen that shows side-by-side
+alignment, within the WIP data set, of the Root, Derivation 1 and
+Derivation 2 members. The matrix is used to manipulate multiple rows
+of Root, Derivation 1, and Derivation 2 members.
