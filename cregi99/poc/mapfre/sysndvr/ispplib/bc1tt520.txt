+A%Complexity Factor+is a value assigned to the WIP file. The
+complexity factor is a function of the number of:
+ * Records in (size of) the WIP file.
+ * Derivation 1 records in conflict.
+ * Derivation 2 records in conflict.
+ * Conflict areas and contention areas.
+
+The complexity factor ranges from 0-5:
% 0+Indicates that no changes occurred in the member.
% 1+Indicates that changes occurred but there are no conflict or
+    contention areas.
% 2-5+Indicate that the member contains conflicts: 2 signifies simple
+     conflicts and 5 signifies complex conflicts.
+
+The complexity factor reflects the number of conflict/contention areas
+in the WIP file, not the number of changes. The higher the number of
+conflict/contention areas, the higher the complexity factor.
