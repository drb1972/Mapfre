+PDM writes the Syntax, Detail, and Summary reports to the C1MSGS1 DD
+statement. It is possible to write the Summary reports to a separate
+data set. If the C1MSGS2 DD statement is defined in the PDM execution
+JCL, PDM writes the Build Summary and Merge Summary reports to the
+C1MSGS2 file.
+
+The C1MSGS2 DD statement can be added to PDM batch execution JCL,
+the PDM batch exeuction skeleton, or you can specify it as additional,
+included JCL in the PDM Submit option.
+
+See Appendix E of the PDM User's Guide for instructions on modifying
+PDM JCL.
