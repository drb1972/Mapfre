%Package Ship Post-Ship Script Execution +

 This feature enables the conditional execution of job steps, called
 scripts, at a remote destination before or after the package
 shipment process has completed. Script files are created by normal
 processor execution and identified as%(SCRIPT-FILES)+through mapping
 rules. Custom script job steps are created by the Administrator by
 editing the shipment JCL models based on your site's requirements.
 In addition, a new Script Execution status can be returned and
 displayed in the%Shipment Status+view by scrolling right.
