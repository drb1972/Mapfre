 Support is added to enable remote package shipment jobs to execute
 under the same name as the jobs on the host system. On the Create
 and Modify Destination panel, Administrators can specify the job
 name with the symbol%$HOSTJNM+in the remote job statement
 information field. This symbol takes the remote job name from the
 host job.
