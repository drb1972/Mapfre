 This release introduces the following enhancements to the Web Services
 component:

%STC pool+
 An STC pool improves the processing performance of web service
 calls to the API. A pool of STCs is maintained for the data source.
 Available STCs in the pool can be reused to execute incoming web
 service calls. New parameters in the data source configuration file
 enable STC pooling.

%Viewable configuration file+
 To verify the content of a specific configuration, you can use the
 new%getConfiguration+service. This operation returns a read-only XML
 file that the administrator can review.
