+Contains an approximation of the average number of members that can
+be contained in one cylinder for datasets which map to this rule.
+Valid values are .01 thru .99 in increments of .01; 1.0 thru 9.9 in
+increments of .1; and 10 thru 999 in increments of 1. If omitted or 0,
+a default of 16 members/cyl is used.
+
+Examples of values less than 1 convert as follows:
+
+  .01 member/cyl = 100 cyls/member
+  .02 member/cyl =  50 cyls/member
+  .05 member/cyl =  20 cyls/member
+  .10 member/cyl =  10 cyls/member
+  .20 member/cyl =   5 cyls/member
+  .50 member/cyl =   2 cyls/member
+
+When packages are staged for shipment or collection, the actual number
+of members being staged is divided by this value and the result plus 1
+cylinder of primary and secondary space will be allocated for the
+staging data set.
