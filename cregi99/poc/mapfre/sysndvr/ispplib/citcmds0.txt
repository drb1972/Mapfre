%   N+- Default. Do not ship complementary data sets.
%   Y+- Ship complementary data sets.

+Complementary data sets contain the backout of a given shipment. For
+example, if a shipment contains the outputs of a package A, then the
+complementary data sets for the shipment contain the backout for
+package A. Conversely, if a shipment contains the backout for
+package B, the complementary data sets contain the outputs for
+package B.
