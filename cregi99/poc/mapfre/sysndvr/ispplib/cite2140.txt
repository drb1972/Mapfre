+Processor load libraries are used to store the executable form of
+processors. To make the best use of processor load libraries,
+allocate one load library for Stage 2 of your production environment,
+then point to this library from all Stages in the life cycle.
+
+Processor listing libraries are optional. They are used to store
+listings when processors are compiled.
