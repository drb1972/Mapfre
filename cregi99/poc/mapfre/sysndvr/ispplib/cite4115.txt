%Auto consol+- Indicates whether change levels are to be consolidated
+   automatically. Acceptable values are:
%     Y+ Consolidate automatically. When you create the 99th change level
+        for an element, change levels 1-50 are consolidated into a single
+        level, changing level 99 to level 50.
%     N+ Default. Do not consolidate automatically. If the value of
+        field is N, LVLS TO CONSOL must be 0.
%Consol at lvl+- Specifies the level number at which change levels are
+  consolidated for elements with reverse or forward deltas.
+  For image deltas, this is the level number at which image levels are
+  removed. The default is 99.
%Lvls to consol+- For reverse and forward element deltas, this
+  indicates the number of deltas to consolidate when the number of levels
+  reaches the figure in the CONSOL AT LVL field. For image element
+  deltas, this indicates the number of image deltas to remove when the
+  number of levels reaches the figure in the CONSOL AT LVL field.
+  The default is 50.
+  This value must be zero if AUTO CONSOL=N, and cannot be greater than
+  the value in the CONSOL AT LVL field.
