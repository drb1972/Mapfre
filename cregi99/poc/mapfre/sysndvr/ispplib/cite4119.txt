%Auto retent+- Indicates whether change levels are to be managed
+   by age. Acceptable value is:
%     Y+ Managed by age. When set, all elements/components change levels
+        under the type's system are managed by age. The 'retain lvls'
+        value on the system panel determines how long change levels are
+        to remain. For reverse/image deltas, change levels that expire
+        are dropped. For forward deltas, change levels that expire are
+        incorporated into the base. This is just an informational field
+        set from the system definition. Age retention values are defined
+        at the system level. This field is only displayed if the system's
+        definition has it active. When inactive, the level's consolidation
+        rules apply.
