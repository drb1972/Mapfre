%Element Recfm -
+
+         Element records can be either a fixed length or a
+         variable length. They are defined by the ELEMENT
+         RECFM IS clause of the TYPE definition. The value
+         affects how the element records are to be processed
+         during a Quick-Edit edit session.
+
+        %NOT DEFINED+-   The type is not predetermined. Quick Edit
+                         uses the input record length to decide if
+                         the Element record is FIXED or VARIABLE.
+                         A Create action in Quick-Edit will cause a
+                         fixed length element to be allocated.
+
+        %FIXED+-         The element records are padded with spaces
+                         up to the TYPE defined source length.
+
+        %VARIABLE+-      The element records retain their length.
