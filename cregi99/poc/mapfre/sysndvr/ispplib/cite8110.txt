+Packages can be approved or denied by people identified
+as approvers. An approver group is a set of approvers.
+
+You can specify for approver groups:
  *%Quorum size.+This is the number of approvers from a group that
+     must approve a package before it can be executed.
  *%Required approvers.+Required approvers must approve a package
+     before it can be executed.
+Even if quorum requirements are met, a package cannot be executed
+until all required approvers have approved it.
+
+Approver groups can be related to inventory areas.
+ * Multiple approver groups can be related to one inventory area.
+ * A single group can be related to many inventory areas.
+Once an approver group has been related to an inventory area, all
+actions against that area must be included in packages.
