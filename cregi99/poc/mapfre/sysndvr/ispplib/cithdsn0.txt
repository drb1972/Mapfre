+A 1 to 44 character name or mask for a data set at a host site.
+
+HOST DATA SET names must have the same number of qualifiers as their
+input production data sets. When the number of qualifiers is not the
+same as the REMOTE DATA SET NAME, the following occurs:
+
+  1. Both data set names are aligned to the right:
+                     example 1                      example 2
+       host:       TESTAP.*.*                  TESTAP.  * .*
+     remote:  PROD.  AP  .*.*                         PROD.*
+
+  2. Production data set names are built using the mask:
+                     example 1                      example 2
+       host:       TESTAP.PROGRAM.LOADLIB      TESTAP.PROGRAM.LOADLIB
+     remote:  PROD.  AP  .PROGRAM.LOADLIB                PROD.LOADLIB
