+A 1 to 768 character name or mask for a path at a host site. All path names
+will be prefixed and appended with a forward slash (/). The host path name
+specified in the mapping rule must have the same number of directories as

+When the number of directories in the host path name specified in the
+mapping rule is different than the number of directories in the remote
+path name specified in the mapping rule, the following occurs:
+
+  1. Path name masks from the mapping rule are generally aligned to the right:
+                example 1                             example 2
+     Mapping rule paths shown here as would be specified:
+       host: /u/TESTAP/*/*/                        /u/TESTAP/*/*/
+     remote: /u/PROD/AP/*/*/                       /u/PROD/*/
+
+     With directories right-aligned to show how mapping occurs:
+       host:   /u   /TESTAP/*/*/                   /u/TESTAP/*   /*/
+     remote: /u/PROD/AP    /*/*/                     /u     /PROD/*/
+
+  2. Remote path names are built from the path name being mapped using the
+     remote path name mask:
+                example 1                             example 2
+     The path being mapped (host) and remote path generated by the mapping
+     rule are shown here as would be specified:
+       host: /u/TESTAP/PROGRAM/LOADLIB/          /u/TESTAP/PROGRAM/LOADLIB/
+     remote: /u/PROD/AP/PROGRAM/LOADLIB/         /u/PROD/LOADLIB/
+
+     With directories right-aligned to show how mapping occurs:
+       host:   /u   /TESTAP/PROGRAM/LOADLIB/       /u/TESTAP/PROGRAM/LOADLIB/
+     remote: /u/PROD/AP    /PROGRAM/LOADLIB/         /u     /PROD   /LOADLIB/
+
+  Alignment from the left occurs only when the leftmost directories for host
+  and remote are the same and the rightmost are explicit and unequal.
