+ISPF library fields appear as FROM ISPF LIBRARY or TO ISPF LIBRARY.
+They are standard ISPF data set specification fields used to identify
+an external data set and member(s) that are the

   *Source for Add, Update, Restore, and certain Transfer actions.

   *Target for Archive, Retrieve, and certain Transfer actions.

+The data set can be a PDS, Librarian, or Panvalet library, or a
+sequential file.

+Use the%Other Partitioned or Sequential Data Sets+field as an
+alternative to the FROM ISPF LIBRARY or TO ISPF LIBRARY fields to
+define source or target external data sets and members. Type the data
+data set and member specification in 'data set(member)' format.
