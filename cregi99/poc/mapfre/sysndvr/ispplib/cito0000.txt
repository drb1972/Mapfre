+Use the USER DEFAULTS panel to establish custom default settings
 for CA Endevor SCM processing.        You can:

  - Allocate space for work and browse data sets used in foreground
    processing.

  - Define printer output class and page size settings for use in fore-
    ground processing.

  - Set a threshold return code above which the execution report for
    actions requested in foreground will display automatically, and
    specify whether ISPF RETURN/JUMP commands are intercepted.
    Also, you can indicate that ISPF BROWSE or VIEW mode is to be used.

  - Record job card settings for use when submitting batch jobs.

 Default specifications remain in effect until you change them again, in
 this session or a subsequent session.
