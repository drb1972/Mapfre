+The Dynamic Approver Group option allows package approvers
+to add additional approvers to a package while it is in
+the 'In-Approval' state. These additional approvers will be
+dynamically defined as one-time approvers for the package.
+
+The Dynamic Approver group is removed from the package when it is
+executed or reset.
+
+You can specify for the Dynamic Approver Group:
+ *%Quorum size.+This is the number of approvers from a group that
+     must approve a package before it can be executed.
+ *%Approvers.+These are the TSO Userids of approvers who can
+     approve or deny the package. Required dynamic approvers must
+     approve a package before it can be executed.
+Even if quorum requirements are met, a package cannot be executed
+until all required dynamic approvers have approved it.
