+Processor groups allow you to use multiple generate, move, or delete
+processors with a single type. For example, if your site has programs
+in batch COBOL and CICS COBOL, processor groups allow you to define a
+type COBOL with two associated processor groups, one for each "flavor"
+of COBOL code.
+
+Processor groups can be defined in both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Groups in
+either Stage can have up to three processors (generate, move, delete).
+
+You must specify a move processor for Stage 2 types if you plan to use
+the map to move from Stage 2 to another environment.
