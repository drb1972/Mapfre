+When the last remote separator is a period, use the last qualifier as the
+extension. The examples map "TESTAP.PROGRAM.C" using the following rules:
+Example 1:  Host mask "TESTAP.*.*" maps to remote mask "C:\PROD\AP\*.*"
+Example 2:  Host mask "TESTAP.*.*" maps to remote mask "C:\PROD.*"
+
+1. Align the real host DSN and the remote mask starting from the right.
+   (DRIVE NOT SHOWN)     example 1                        example 2
+   real host:           TESTAP.PROGRAM.C            TESTAP.PROGRAM.C
+   remote mask:    PROD\  AP  \   *   .*                      PROD.*
+
+2. Filter the real host qualifiers thru the remote mask to get a remote path.
+   In both examples "C" becomes the extension.
+   (DRIVE NOT SHOWN)     example 1                        example 2
+   real host:           TESTAP.PROGRAM.C            TESTAP.PROGRAM.C
+   remote mask:    PROD\  AP  \   *   .*                      PROD.*
+   real remote:    PROD\  AP  \PROGRAM                        PROD
+
%Note:+If you do not want package outputs in a host data set to be collected,
+      leave the remote mask blank.
