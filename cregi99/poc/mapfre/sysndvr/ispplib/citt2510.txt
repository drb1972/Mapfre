+Consider using generic type names, such as COBOL.  You can then create
+as many processor groups as you need to handle the variations within
+each type. For instance, for type COBOL, you could create processor
+groups to indicate what type of COBOL must be processed.
+
+A list of suggested naming standards for types follows.  This list is
+not complete and is presented here as a guideline only.
