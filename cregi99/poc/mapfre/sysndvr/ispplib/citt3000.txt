+A major piece of the implementation is to define the stages in the
+software lifecycles at your site, then organize these stages into
+environments. See Chapter 1 of the Administrator's Guide.

+Applications in each life cycle follow a unique route through the
+environment/stage locations that you have defined.  You can set up as
+many routes as you need to accommodate different life cycles at your
+site.  These%routes+make up the%map+for your site.

+These routes are used to automate the adding, displaying, retrieving,
+moving, and generating of inventory in a given life cycle.
