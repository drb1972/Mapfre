+  The Retrieve action searches for an element along the environment
+  map, beginning with the environment and stage specified in the action.
+  Thus, if you always retrieve from the lowest stage in the software life
+  cycle, the search capability allows the most current version of the
+  element to be found automatically.
+
+  When FIRST FOUND=Y, RETRIEVE obtains the first instance of the
+  element that it finds.
