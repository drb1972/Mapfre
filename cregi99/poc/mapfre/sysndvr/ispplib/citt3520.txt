+  The Add action supports copyback and signout checking across the
+  environment map.  When you add an element, The map is searched for
+  additional occurrences of that element.  If it finds the element at
+  another map location, ADD validates the sign-out, copies the element
+  back to the target location for the Add, and performs a comparison
+  to create a delta level.
+
+  Additionally, you do not have to specify a processor group unless you
+  want to assign a group that is different that the group associated with
+  an existing element or the default group assigned to new elements.
