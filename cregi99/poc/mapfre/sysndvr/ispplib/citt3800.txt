+When defining routes for a map:
+
+ * Set up routes that reflect your software life cycles.  Draw a
+   diagram of the routes first, using the examples in the
+   Administrator's Guide, chapter 4, as examples.
+
+ * Establish the routes in the C1DEFLTS Table
+
+ * Use the System, Subsystem, Type, and Processor Group Definition panels
+   to identify inventory classifications and processor groups at the
+   successive locations in each route.
+
+ * Run CONRPT07, System Definition Profile, to verify that you have
+   set up the correct routes.  Also run CONRPT07 whenever you change a
+   route, to verify that you have made the modifications correctly.
+   See the Reports manual for a sample of the CONRPT07.
