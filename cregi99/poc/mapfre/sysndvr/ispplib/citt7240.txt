+After the package is cast, it contains either a copy of the footprint
+of the source element or a checksum value for source members from an
+external data set.
+
+Before executing the package, the members or elements referenced by
+the package are validated to ensure no changes have been made.  If any
+differences exist at that time, the package is not executed.
