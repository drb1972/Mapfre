+Package processing provides you with the ability to backout and
+and subsequently backin, change packages. The backout/backin option
+is available only after you have executed a package. All package
+event information, as well as backout/backin data, is maintained
+with the package until you commit the package.
+
+Committing a package removes any backout/backin data while retaining
+package event information.  A package should be committed only when
+you are sure that you will no longer need to back it in.
