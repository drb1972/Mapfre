+The package shipment utility uses data transmission programs to
+distribute package outputs (source, object, listing, or load modules),
+or package backout members from a host site to another site. It is
+designed for users who develop software at a central site and want to
+transmit source, object, or executable code either locally or to other
+(remote) sites.
+
+To use the package shipment utility:
+  * Packages must be created with BACKOUT ENABLED=Y.
+  * Packages must have been executed, but not committed
+* One of these data transmission packages must be available
+  - XCOM (CAI)
+  - Bulk Data Transfer (IBM) Version 2, or via NJE/NJI
+  - NetView File Transfer Program Version 1 (IBM)
+  - Connect:Direct (IBM, formerly Network DataMover)
+  * Remote destinations must be defined
