+Component List Information
+
%   Listing Dataset String+- This is the string value which is used
+   by the%LL - List Listing+option for dataset selection.  Any string
+   from%1-8+characters may be specified.  This field is initially set
+   to the value of the%C1DEFLTS+table parameter%COMPLISTWD.+ If the
+   parameter is not coded or blank, a default value of%LIST+is used.
+   If you modify this field, the value you specify remains until
+   modified again.  Clearing the value causes the field to be set
+   to LIST.
+
+   The%LL+option selects datasets from the output component list by
+   examining each dataset name for the specified string.  If the
+   string is found in the dataset name, then that entry will be added
+   to the outputs selection list.  This is intended to be used as a
+   shortcut for viewing a stored listing for the selected member.
